  "How do I change Inches to Decimal Feet and Avoid Errors?": "Bud Caldwell, one of the best Superintendents I ever worked with, taught me the value of changing inches into decimal feet. We were reviewing a shop drawing for a piece of equipment with lots of anchor bolts, and everything was in feet, inches and fractions of an inch. In his head, he quickly converted the inches and fractions of an inch into decimal feet, so we could easily add and check dimensions. He showed me a wonderful little trick of the trade that I've used for over 25 years. Theinches to decimal feet conversion tableshows illustrates the information.As you know, adding fractions challenges most of us. We probably learned the concept of lowest common denominator at some point, but struggle to remember how to actually use it. So to add feet and inches, we have to deal with fractions and with that 12\" in a foot concept, which means we have to add by hand, using pencil and paper. Special calculators for adding feet, inches and fractions of inches are available, but they always seemed difficult to use for me. So adding a string of dimensions in feet, inches and fractions of an inch gets much easier if we can simply convert to decimal feet.Numerous situations occur where these conversions help:Checking a string of dimensions to verify they correctly addComparing elevations between a site drawing (normally in decimal feet) and an architectural drawing (often in feet and inches)Laying out accessible ramps and accessibility routesLet's use accessible route as an example. Say the building finished floor elevation is 401' - 6 1/4\" and the grade at the parking space is 400.14'. The sidewalk between the parking space and the front door has a distance of 30'. Now you probably know that an accessible route has a maximum slope of 5%, or it becomes a ramp and needs handrails. So 401' - 6 1/4\" converts to 401.52. Then subtract 400.14 to find the grade change of 1.38'. To find the slope, divide the grade change of 1.38' by the distance of 30' to get a slope of .046 or 4.6%, which is less than the maximum of 5% allowed by code. So it works.",
  "What are the Basic Area and Volume Formulas?": "To figure how much concrete to order for a slab on grade, you need to know some basic area and volume formulas. Most of us understand that length times the width times the thickness gives us the volume. We may need a bit more help, though, when the things aren't rectangular or other complexities arise. Let's start with an example and work through how to utilize the geometry of common shapes.Hopefully, the example above makes sense to you and simply illustrates a few useful concepts. If you need some help understanding the example, you may want to review theUS Navy Basic Math and Algebratraining class. This course give lots of basic and more advanced information for understanding math.The areas and volumes of common geometric shapes probably don't need to be memorized. It's usually simple just to know where to easily find the formulas. By knowing how to use these formulas, you will be able to solve many construction problems, such as:How much soil needs to be moved? How many truckloads will actually be hauled? How many trucks are needed on site?How much concrete to order for the pour?How much does something weigh? What will it take to lift it?How much water will be in that pool? How long will it take to fill it?These questions and many more get solved by knowing how to calculate the areas and volumes ofCommon Geometric Shapes.",
  "Why Converting Units will be One of the Most Useful Things You will Ever Learn?": "I remember learning how to convert units in Biology Class in high school. I've used that skill ever since that time and it has helped me solve many problems (and avoid lots of mistakes). The process of converting units is simple and powerful. The secret to consistently getting the right answers lies in always listing the units and taking the time to cancel the units as you proceed through the process. A few examples shown below in \"Converting Units - Examples\" which illustrates the process clearly.By learning to solve problems by setting up simple math problems, you will be amazed at how many complicated issues you can understand and problems you can solve. The problem solver with a good attitude advances, making more money and getting more responsibility. So take the time to learn how to set up simple math problems that help you convert units. Use this same technique every time:Always write the problem down.Always list the units (even if it seems simple to you)Always go through and cancel the units to make sure the answer you get is in the correct unitsThis simple little technique can really help you.",
  "How do I Learn the Basics of Math and Algebra?": "The ability to use math as a tool can separate you from many others in the construction field. Just as carpenters work at a level above laborers partly because of their skill with tools, you can work at a higher level with the ability to formulate and solve number problems.TheUS Navy Basic Math and Algebracourse provides instruction that assumes no prior knowledge. You can use this course in one of two ways:Work through the entire course from start to finish and gain a firm understanding of the fundamentals.Focus on an area you need to understand right now (perhaps percentages aren't clear to you or how to solve problems with fractions or maybe you need a review of simple algebra to know how to find the unknown quantity in a situation).The advantage of working through the entire course comes from the fact that math knowledge builds on itself. The more clearly you understand the basic building blocks of math, the better you will learn and retain more advanced concepts. The disadvantage of working through the entire course is the time it will take and that you will probably learn many things that aren't directly applicable to construction.",
  "How do I Know When to Fold-'em in Texas Hold-'em?": "You don't really need to know anything about Probability and Statistics for construction (at least I don't think you do). So why do I include the US Navy Probability and Statistics courses? It's cool stuff to know.Understanding basic probability theory helps you understand life. To have a basic grasp of how random events happen will allow you to better assess risks and rewards. And it helps your poker game! You can check out some teaching about probability at theUS Navy Pre-Calculus and Probabilitycourse.Statistics, on the other hand, is the math that helps you understand large bunches of information. We use statistics to help us make informed decisions. A construction company, as an example, may be concerned with improving productivity for its trades people. As various bits of information is analyzed, perhaps they find that the absenteeism on Fridays is significantly higher than any other day. Statistics can be used to help understand how much of that absenteeism is just random or if it's a significant finding. Say the statistics indicate a substantially higher absenteeism on Fridays, then the company looks for causes. The employees get their paychecks on Thursday afternoons. So now there is a management choice to be made.Many construction companies use quality improvement programs that utilize statistics. If a company wants to improve results, they must understand what's really going on in their day to day processes. To understand how processes are truly working, we need to measure things, then try to figure out what is significant. Statistics help us understand what is really going on. Some good teaching on statistics can be found in theUS Navy Introduction to Statisticscourse.",
  "What are 3 Useful Trigonometry Concepts?": "When most people hear \"Trigonometry\", they they assume it's something they could never understand nor use. I've actually never had a course on trigonometry, so I'm no expert, but I learned three really useful things on my own. Sine, Cosine and Tangent help me solve all sorts of problems. If I'm actively involved in building anything, I'm using these few simple formulas. The figure below explains the concepts and gives some examples.If you want some more information on trigonometry, see theUS Navy Trigonometrycourse.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Basic Math:": "Convert feet, inches and fractions of an inch to decimal feet to easily add, subtract and multiply.When converting units, always write the units and cancel them as you proceed through the conversion.Use sine, cosine and tangent to determine angles and side lengths in right triangles (useful trigonometry).",
  "What can I Learn about Water in a 55 Gallon Drum?": "The first high concrete wall I helped form and place taught me a great lesson about fluid dynamics. As the concrete was being placed in this deep form on a sewage treatment plant, the bottom of the form burst outward and concrete started flowing out into the dirt. The experienced guys rushed around trying to re-brace the form, then all the stories started about terrible form failures. Guys spoke about the sound of form ties snapping and the huge danger of all that concrete pressure. I didn't really understand where all the pressure came from. The example of the 55 gallon drum helped me grasp the concept.If we fill a 55 gallon drum with water, we have a container filled with  fluid. So what is unique about a fluid? Basically that it flows. A fluid flows. If we put a pumpkin in the 55 gallon drum, the pumpkin would sit on the bottom of the drum, it would exert a pressure on the bottom of the drum due to its own weight, but it would not exert any pressure on the sides of the drum.If we filled the drum with water, though, the water would push down on the bottom of the drum but also outward against the sides. In fact, a fluid pushes perpendicularly (outward) against any surface that contains it. This pushing outward by the water against the drum surface is called pressure.So how does this pressure vary? Fluid pressure increases with depth. So at the very top of the 55 gallon drum, no water pressure pushes outward. Go down a foot in the drum and the pressure increases. Go down to the bottom and it increases more.Putting numbers to this concept helps make it clearer and the sketch below illustrates.Notice the units that show the pressure on the example above. At 3.5' depth, the water pressure pushing out (or pushing down) is 218.4 pounds per square foot (psf). Think of a big man standing with his feet real close together on a little 1' x1' floor tile and you've got the concept of 218.4 psf. Now notice that 1.52 pounds per square inch (psi) is the exact same pressure, just with a different unit. Every square inch under that 12\" x 12\" floor tile would have a pressure of 1.52 psi.It's valuable to have a working understanding of pressures in psi and psf. You probably have about 50 psi water pressure in your house. So how high a barrel of water would you need to have 50 psi pressure at the bottom? 50 psi x 144 square inches/square feet / 62.4 pounds/cubic feet yields 115 feet of water height. So you'd need a barrel of water 115 feet high to create 50 psi of water pressure.Now think of that 50 psi of water pressure and try to think of it in psf. How can you visualize that 50 psi of pressure in your home's water pipes? The calculation is simple, just multiply 50 psi by 144 square inches/square feet to get the 7200 psf answer. So if we go back to our 12\" x 12\" floor tile, that's our 200 pound man standing there holding 35 other 200 pound men on his shoulders. Wow!Now let's think about another aspect of fluid pressure, does the pressure change if the 55 gallon drum changes to a 2\" vertical pipe filled with water? What happens to the water pressure at 1' depth? at 3.5' depth? The water pressure stays exactly the same...it's dependent on the depth, but not on the width of the container. So the water pressure at 3.5' depth will be 1.52 psi whether it's in a 55 gallon drum, a 2\" vertical pipe or against a swimming pool wall. Water pressure depends on depth. A helpful rule of thumb to remember is that every foot of height equals about 1/2 psi of water pressure. So the 3.5 foot deep 55 gallon drum has about 2 psi and the 50 psi water service about 100' of water column height. The 1/2 psi per 1' of water height is approximate, but helpful to get you in the ballpark of the actual pressures.When thinking about concrete forming and placing of walls, though, and important consideration changes. The density of the fluid changes from 62.4 pcf for water to 150 pcf for liquid concrete. So a 18' deep concrete wall form, if it was filled completely with liquid concrete would have a pressure of 150 pcf x 18'\u00a0 which equals 2700 psf. Since a standard form ties typically carries about 2000 pounds, we'd need ties closer than 1' on center to pour this entire wall at one time. The normal method for wall placement involves placing the wall in lifts, so that the concrete hardens and is no longer liquid in the lower lift prior to the upper lift being placed. So if our 18' deep wall was placed in three 6' lifts, then the 150 pcf x 6' yields a wall pressure of 900 psf. Wall form ties could be placed at 2' on center (giving 2,000 pounds of structural capacity for a 1800 pound load).",
  "Water at Basement Walls: What Makes the Wall Fall Down?": "In many homes, the basement walls fail, cracking and leaking water into the house. Did you know that water is often the culprit for those failed basement walls? Most people don't understand the significant pressures that water exerts on a wall. The sketch below illustrates the concepts.The sketch shows the water table about 8' above the bottom of the basement wall. The pressure that water exerts on the wall gets higher with depth. The middle sketch illustrates the concept. Many times retaining walls and basement walls are designed assuming that any standing water behind the wall will be released by underdrains. It's important for the Superintendent to pay attention to underdrain details shown on construction drawings. Many walls have failed because of water pressure against walls that weren't designed to resist those forces.So when a retaining wall detail shows crushed stone and a 4\" pipe at the backfilled side of the wall, that wall was probably designed assuming that any water behind that wall would be drained away by the underdrain. In rough terms, that wall may have to be twice as strong to resist those water pressure forces that come from not having proper drainage. So make sure you pay attention to wall underdrains if there is any possibility of water pressure behind the wall.",
  "What Should I Know about Piping Systems: Pressure, Flow and Head?": "Bud Caldwell, one of the most amazing Superintendent's I've ever worked with, taught me the value of understanding the basics of fluid flow. He learned that many design Engineers knew how to do the calculations, but didn't really understand how the pressures worked. He avoided several disastrous results by learning both the basic equations and paying attention to the physical realities of fluid flow. You will also benefit from understanding the basics here.Fluids can flow in several types of systems. In an open system, storm water may be flowing down through a swale towards the stream. In an open piping system, a water tank may have water to a height of 100' above grade, that then flows through pipes to feed home use. In a pressurized piping system, a pump adds pressure to the water flowing through those pipes. In each of these systems, the same basics of fluid pressure apply.The thing in common, here, is the fluid flowing. The fluid starts to flow in order to equalize the pressure. That's a fancy way of saying that water flows downhill. The pressure that is equalized in fluids is called head and is the standard unit of measure for fluids. The amount of energy in the fluid stream is made up of the components in the sketch below:To actually use these equations in a piping system, one also must consider the smoothness of the pipe and the friction losses that occur as the fluid flows through the pipe. Charts that provide this information for various types of pipe are found in the Appendix of the International Plumbing Code.When working with pressures, though, you need to understand the difference between absolute pressure and gage (or atmospheric) pressure. The graphic below illustrates the concept.Absolute pressure is pressure in a vacuum. When dealing with real world problems here on Earth, though, we usually work in gage (or atmospheric) pressure. The difference between the two is obvious, but just remember psia stands for pounds per square inch absolute pressure (in a vacuum) and psig stands for pounds per square inch gage pressure (found on Earth).Some useful tables, figures and worked examples for water flow in pipes and designing water distributions are found in aUS Army Field Manual.",
  "What Should I Know about Pumps?": "On my first large job as a project engineer, we installed a sewage sludge dewatering press and my job was to prove that the performance of the press met the performance specifications. So I had to figure out how much water was going into the press and how much was coming out. I remember setting up this test to flow the water from the pump into a large container and measure the time to fill, figuring I could then know the gallons per minute that was going into the press. The old Resident Engineer on the project pulled me aside and explained that my approach was simply wrong. He said, \"Don't you understand pump curves?\" I didn't and ended up wasting lots of time and looking kind of stupid.As the old fellow (who was probably about the age I am now) explained to me, a pump curve shows how a pump actually delivers under various levels of flow restriction. In other words, the amount of fluid pumped will vary greatly with the amount of friction head or elevation head it must overcome. That made sense to me after I thought about it. Pump curves can be obtained from the pump manufacturers when you have a specific pump to evaluate. So as a simple trick of the trade, remember to use pump curves if you need to evaluate how a pump will perform.A pump moves and/or compresses fluids, creating velocity and pressure. The basic three types of pumps are centrifugal, reciprocating and rotary.Centrifugal pumps use centrifugal force to force the liquid out away from the central rotating shaft. The impeller blades used to move this fluid are curved backward relative to the direction of flow (see sketch below). As the fluid spins outward, it exits through the discharge with increased speed and pressure. The intake of fluid is often near the center of the propellers. Multi-stage centrifugal pumps have the discharge from one pump directly tying into the intake of the next pump, thus increasing both velocity and pressure of the fluid.Reciprocating pumps use a back and forth motion to displace the liquid with solid pump piston or plunger. This positive displacement of the liquid creates a compression and increased pressure. Since the piston or plunger needs to be tight fitting to create that compression, packing or piston rings need to be used, as well as check valves. In construction, reciprocating mud pumps or trash pumps tend to be the workhorses on a job site. They can pump out areas filled with water and tend to not clog too easily.Rotary pumps are also positive displacement pumps, though their flow is continuous in one direction and no check valves are required. The sketch below illustrates the concept.",
  "What Should I Know about Gas Pressure, Temperature and Volume?": "It's helpful to know a couple of basics about how gases behave. A gas flows, as does a liquid. Unlike a liquid, though, gas fills a container and exerts a constant pressure on all sides of that container. Two simple rules about gases come in handy:The pressure of a gas varies directly with the temperature when the volume is constant. For example, if a bottle of oxygen gas is in a fire, as the temperature rises, the pressure will rise proportionally. Of course, that bottle of oxygen in a fire creates a very dangerous possibility of exploding (that's why it's good to understand this concept).The volume of a gas varies directly with the temperature when the pressure is constant. Think about a balloon that's heated, the pressure is constant but the volume will expand proportionately with the temperature.",

  "Why I Should Know the 3 Laws of Thermodynamics?": "The laws of thermodynamics can be comically paraphrased as follows:You really can't win.It's wishful thinking to think you can break even.And you can't even get out of the game.The actual laws are paraphrased here:Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only altered in form.Any engine must be less than 100% efficient.It's impossible to reach the temperature of absolute zero.The first law helps you understand the nature of energy...helps you know that energy doesn't get used up, it changes in form. So when you pour gasoline into a job site generator, you will get electricity, but not up to the full energy level of the gasoline that was used. Some of that gasoline energy goes into heat of exhaust and some into friction, which also produces heat. The amount of energy in that gasoline doesn't lessen, it just takes other forms.The second law helps us understand that while engines may keep getting more efficient, they will never be completely efficient (100%) and certainly never be \"perpetual motion machines\".The third law doesn't seem to have any practical applications, I just included it because I liked the paraphrase \"And you can't even get out of the game\".If you want a more detailed explanation of thermodynamics, go to the US Department of EnergyFundamentals Handbook on Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow.You should understand the basic principle that energy doesn't get used up, it changes form. You will simply understand the physical world better with this knowledge. Honest.",
  "How does Energy Differ from Power?": "Whenever I hear someone on the jobsite using the wrong units (they say pounds of air pressure when they mean psi or they say BTUs when they mean BTUs/hour or BTUs/sec), I think two things. One, they don't really understand what they are talking about. Two, they will be making some mistakes due to that misunderstanding that could be easily avoided. Pet Peeve alert! Learn and use the correct units. It will make you look smarter and save you some aggravation.So how does energy differ from power? Energy is the ability to do work. 1 BTU heats 1 pound of water 1 degree Fahrenheit. It takes energy to drive your car, heat your house, or charge your battery. Another example: 1 KiloWatt-hour of energy lights a 100 Watt bulb for 10 hours.I think of power, on the other hand, as capacity. Power is the rate at which energy is used. BTUs/hour, Horsepower and KiloWatts are are units of power. That light bulb has the capacity to use 100 Watts, it's level of power is 100 Watts. The Formula One race car has the capacity of delivering 1000 HP, while a Ford Pinto powers along at 88 HP. The Formula One race car can use energy faster than the Ford Pinto (unless the Pinto is exploding from a rear collision, then that's a different calculation).So let's do a quick calculation to compare the gasoline usage of the Formula One vehicle and the Pinto. We can easily find that gasoline has an energy value of 125,000 BTUs.So the energy is in the gasoline (and yes, I know a Formula One doesn't run on gasoline), but the power is the capacity either vehicle has to use that energy over time. When trying to remember the units, the little graphic above about power (having a W) and watts is helpful.Since I'm working on some solar energy projects, let's try an example from that field. The sun's energy on a given surface is called the irradiance. So that's the energy portion. The power portion is radiation. The radiation is the irradiance measured over time (just like power is energy measured over time). Solar radiation data is measured in KiloWatt-hours per square meter per day. From solar radiation charts, we find a horizontal plane in Harrisburg PA in March gets an average of 3.3 KiloWatt-hours per square meter per day.To recap, the most common energy units are BTUs, KiloWatt-hours while the power units are BTUs/hour, Horsepower and KiloWatts. The rest of theconversion unitsare also available on this site.",
  "What are the Basic Energy Unit Conversions?": "While the measurement conversions are shown in a detailed way by following this link (measurement conversions), it's worth considering the basic energy units. A few energy unit conversions are worth trying to memorize, just to be able to do some quick calculations in your head.1 Kilowatt = 3,413 Btu/hour1 ton of air conditioning = 12,000 Btu/hour1 person in a room adds about 250 Btu/hour or the equivalent of a 75 watt light bulb1 HP (motor) = 746 watts (operating energy)1 gallon of gasoline = 125,000 BTUs1,000,000 Btu/hour = 10 therms or 1,000 cubic feet of Natural Gas= 46 pounds or 10.88 gallons of Propane Gas= 7.14 gallons of No. 2 Fuel Oil (diesel fuel)= 293 KW of electricityThe energy unit Btu stands for British Thermal Unit and is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Power differs from energy because power refers to the rate at which work is performed or energy is transmitted. So the standard unit for power is Btu/hour. Unfortunately, many times units of power are also referred to as Btu, instead of the correct Btu/hour. When evaluating power units, be aware that the term Btu is often misused when Btu/hour should be used.",
  "What I Should Know about Heat Transfer: Conduction, Convection and Radiation?": "Understanding the basics of how heat transfers will help you in correctly seeing how buildings get hot and get cold. These simple building blocks of knowledge will allow you to better evaluate more complicated systems.Conductionis a transfer of thermal energy from a region of higher temperature to that of lower temperature. Across a pane of glass, separating the warm interior from the cold exterior, the heat conducts through the glass to the outside. The actual work of conduction occurs by the molecules in the glass moving against each other and transferring the heat. So the molecular structure of the material affects its conduction. A piece of steel conducts heat through it quickly, while a piece of wood more slowly and Styrofoam insulation much more slowly. Therefore, building walls and roofs use insulating materials to slow the heat transfer (of heat during the heating season and cold during the cooling season) so that the building space will be more comfortable and use less energy to condition.Convection acts as another form of heat transfer, utilizing fluid flow. As the heat transfers through the glass pane described above, the outside air blows across the window, using convection to transfer the heat. In natural convection, the fluid warms, becomes less dense and rises. In forced convection, fans and pumps force the fluid to move and create a heat transfer convection current. When considering the heating and cooling of a building, the cracks around windows, doors, vents, etc. all have convection zipping the heat energy away from the facility.Radiation transfer heat in quite a different manner than conduction (molecules in a solid bouncing into each other and transferring energy) and convection (a fluid flowing by a surface and transferring energy). Radiation does not need a solid or even a fluid medium to transfer heat. Radiation uses electromagnetic energy waves to radiate energy away from the source. Radiation can work in a perfect vacuum, or through a perfect vacuum. The Sun radiates energy to the Earth through the vacuum of space. Just as insulation slows heat transfer from conduction, radiant barriers reflect radiation back to the object and slow heat transfer. The foil backed fiberglass batt insulation acts as a radiant barrier, with the foil backing reflecting the radiant energy back into the space.A complete guide to Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, and Fluid Flow is provided in a 3-part manual.Volume Iis titled DOE-HDBK-1012/1-92 (June 1992) and is 138 pages,Volume IIis 32 pages and titled DOE-HDBK-1012/2-92 (June 1992), andVolume IIItitled HT-03 is 12 pages.",

  "Why Should I Care about 6 Simple Machines?": "You should care because it's cool stuff that helps you understand how almost everything works on the jobsite. The text on this page is lifted from the US Navy training manuals and referenced throughout the page.Through the ages, ships have evolved from crude rafts to the huge complex cruisers and carriers of today\u2019s Navy. It was a long step from oars to sails, another long step from sails to steam, and another long step to today\u2019s nuclear power. Each step in the progress of shipbuilding has involved the use of more and more machines. Today\u2019s Navy personnel are specialists in operating and maintaining machinery. Boatswains operate winches to hoist cargo and the anchor; personnel in the engine room operate pumps, valves, generators, and other machines to produce and control the ship\u2019s power; personnel in the weapons department operate shell hoists and rammers and elevate and train the guns and missile launchers; the cooks operate mixers and can openers; personnel in the CB ratings drive trucks and operate cranes, graders, and bulldozers. In fact, every rating in the Navy uses machinery sometime during the day\u2019s work. Each machine used aboard ship has made the physical work load of the crew lighter; you don\u2019t walk the capstan to raise the anchor, or heave on a line to sling cargo aboard. Machines are your friends. They have taken much of the backache and drudgery out of a sailor\u2019s lift. Reading this book should help you recognize and understand the operation of many of the machines you see about you.WHAT IS A MACHINE? As you look about you, you probably see half a dozen machines that you don\u2019t recognize as such. Ordinarily you think of a machine as a complex device-a gasoline engine or a typewriter. They are machines; but so are a hammer, a screwdriver, a ship\u2019s wheel. A machine is any device that helps you to do work. It may help by changing the amount of force or the speed of action. A claw hammer, for example, is a machine. You can use it to apply a large force for pulling out a nail; a relatively small pull on the handle produces a much greater force at the claws. We use machines to transformenergy. For example, a generator transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy. We use machines totransferenergy from one place to another. For example, the connecting rods, crankshaft, drive shaft, and rear axle of an automobile transfer energy from the engine to the rear wheels. Another use of machines is to multiply force. We use a system of pulleys (a chain hoist, for example) to lift a heavy load. The pulley system enables us to raise the load by exerting a force that is smaller than the weight of the load. We must exert this force over a greater distance than the height through which the load is raised; thus, the load will move slower than the chain on which we pull. The machine enables us to gain force, but only at the expense of speed. Machines may also be used to multiply speed. The best example of this is the bicycle, by which we gain speed by exerting a greater force. Machines are also used to change the direction of a force. For example, the Signalman\u2019s halyard enables one end of the line to exert an upward force on a signal flag while a downward force is exerted on the other end. There are only six simple machines: the lever, the block, the wheel and axle, the inclined plane, the screw, and the gear. Physicists, however, recognize only two basic principles in machines: those of the lever and the inclined plane. The wheel and axle, block and tackle, and gears may be considered levers. The wedge and the screw use the principle of the inclined plane. When you are familiar with the principles of these simple machines, you can readily understand the operation of complex machines. Complex machines are merely combinations of two or more simple machines.",
  "How Levers Work?": "THE LEVERThe simplest machine, and perhaps the one with which you are most familiar, is the lever. A seesaw is a familiar example of a lever in which one weight balances the other. You will find that all levers have three basic parts: the fulcrum (F), a force or effort (E), and a resistance (R). Look at the lever in figure 1-1.You see the pivotal point (fulcrum) (F); the effort (E), which is applied at a distance (A) from the fulcrum; and a resistance (R), which acts at a distance (a) from the fulcrum. Distances A and a are the arms of the lever.CLASSES OF LEVERSThe three classes of levers are shown in figure 1-2. The location of the fulcrum (the fixed or pivot point) in relation to the resistance (or weight) and the effort determines the lever class.First ClassIn the first class (fig. 1-2, part A), the fulcrum is located between the effort and the resistance. As mentioned earlier, the seesaw is a good example of a first-class lever. The amount of weight and the distance from the fulcrum can be varied to suit the need. Notice that the sailor in figure 1-3 applies effort on the handles of the oars. An oar is another good example. The oarlock is the fulcrum, and the water is the resistance. In this case, as in figure 1-1, the force is applied on one side of the fulcrum and the resistance to be overcome is applied to the opposite side; hence, this is a first class lever. Crowbars, shears, and pliers are common examples of this class of levers.Second ClassThe second class of lever (fig. 1-2, part B) has the fulcrum at one end, the effort applied at the other end, and the resistance somewhere between those points. TheFigure 1-2.-Three classes of levers. Figure 1-3.-Oars are levers.wheelbarrow in figure 1-4 is a good example of a second-class lever. If you apply 50 pounds of effort to the handles of a wheelbarrow 4 feet from the fulcrum (wheel), you can lift 200 pounds of weight 1 foot from the fulcrum. If the load were placed farther away from the wheel, would it be easier or harder to lift? Levers of the first and second class are commonly used to help in overcoming big resistances with a relatively small effort.Third ClassSometimes you will want to speed up the movement of the resistance even though you have to use a large amount of effort. Levers that help you accomplish this are in the third class of levers. As shown in figure 1-2, part C, the fulcrum is at one end of the lever, and the weight or resistance to be overcome is at the other end, with the effort applied at some point between. You can always spot the third-class levers because you will find the effort applied between the fulcrum and the resistance. Look at figure 1-5. It is easy to see that while E moved the short distance (e), the resistance (R) was moved a greater distance (r). The speed of R must have been greater than that of E, since R covered a greater distance in the same length of time. Your arm (fig. 1-6) is a third-class lever. It is this lever action that makes it possible for you to flex your arms so quickly. Your elbow is the fulcrum. Your biceps muscle, which ties onto your forearm about an inch below the elbow, applies the effort; your hand is the resistance, located about 18 inches from the fulcrum. In the split second it takes your biceps muscle to contract an inch, your hand has moved through an 18-inch arc. You know from experience that it takes a big pull at E to overcome a relatively small resistance at R. Just to experience this principle, try closing a door by pushing on it about 3 or 4 inches from the hinges (fulcrum). The moral is, you don\u2019t use third-class levers to do heavy jobs; you use them to gain speed.One convenience of machines is that you can determine in advance the forces required for their operation, as well as the forces they will exert. Consider for a moment the first class of levers. Suppose you have an iron bar, like the one shown in figure 1-7. This bar is 9 feet long, and you want to use it to raise a 300-pound crate off the deck while you slide a dolly under the crate; but you can exert only 100 pounds to lift the crate. So, you place the fulcrum-a wooden block-beneath one end of the bar and force that end of the bar under the crate. Then, you push down on the other end of the bar. After a few adjustments of the position of the fulcrum, you will find that your 100-pound force will just fit the crate when the fulcrum is 2 feet from the center of the crate. That leaves a 6-foot length of bar from the fulcrum to the point where you pushdown. The 6-foot portion is three times as long as the distance from the fulcrum to the center of the crate. And you lifted a load three times as great as the force you applied (3 x 100 = 300 pounds).There is another thing about the first and second classes of levers that you have probably noticed by now.Since they can be used to magnify the applied force, they provide positive mechanical advantages. The third-classlever provides what is called a fractional mechanical advantage, which is really a mechanical disadvantage\u2014you use more force than the force of the load you lift.In the wheelbarrow problem, you saw that a 50-pound pull actually overcame the 200-pound weightFigure 1-9.-A curved lever arm. of the sand. The sailor\u2019s effort was magnified four times, so you may say that the mechanical advantage of thewheelbarrow is 4. Expressing the same idea in mathematical terms,MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE = RESISTANCE/EFFORTor, in the case of the wheelbarrow, M.A. = 200/50 = 4This rule\u2014mechanical advantage equals resistance (load) divided by effort \u2014applies to all machines.The mechanical advantage of a lever may also be found by dividing the length of effort arm A by the lengthof resistance arm a. Stated as a formula, this reads:M.A. of a lever = Effort Arm/Resistance ArmHow does this apply to third-class levers? Your muscle pulls with a force of 1,800 pounds to lift a 100-pound projectile. So you have a mechanical advantage of 100/1800 or 1/18th,\u00a0 which is fractional-less than 1.The basic machines get used every day on your jobsite. If you understand the principles, you\u2019ll be in a better position to solve problems that develop. Think of a simple but treacherous example. A building partially collapses and traps a worker under a big chunk of concrete floor. A back hoe can\u2019t get into the space and you have to act quickly.The piece of floor is about 8\u2019 x 4\u2019 and 6\u201d thick. You know, or should know, that concrete weighs 150 pounds per cubic foot and that 8 x 4 x .5 = 16 cf. So 16 cf x 150 lb/cf = 2,400 pounds.To lift the concrete off the trapped worker, you\u2019d need 12 guys each lifting 100 pounds to lift half the weight, to lift it up like you were lifting the load on a wheel barrow (which is a 2ndclass lever). But you don\u2019t have 12 guys, you\u2019ve got two guys and some long sections of 3\u201d sprinkler piping. You know you could use the pipe as a 1stclass lever to lift the slab.So how long a piece of pipe do you need? If you\u2019ve only got two guys to help with the lever, and one to pull the trapped worker out, you could assume that each guy could pull down 150 pounds, so you have a force of 300 pounds to work with. If you have a pivot point 2\u2019 from your lift point, you need at lease 8\u2019 of pipe on the side of pivot point to lift the 1200 pound concrete and free the worker. So if you grab a 12\u2019 section of pipe, you free the trapped worker.If you only have one person to lift, you probably could still free the guy if you have a 20\u2019 section of pipe. The ability to do those quick calculations, and even more importantly, to understand the basic lever principles will be useful for the rest of your life. So why not take a few minutes and learn the basics of the 6 simple machines?Additional information and explanation is available in the following,Basic Machines Training Course -US Navy(\"Levers\" excerpt, NAVEDTRA 14037, 1994)",
  "How Blocks (Pulleys) Work?": "Blocks or pulleys are simple machines that have many uses aboard ship, as well as onshore. Remember how your mouth hung open as you watched movers taking a piano out of a fourth story window? The guy on the end of the tackle eased the piano safely to the sidewalk with a mysterious arrangement of blocks and ropes. Or, you\u2019ve been in the country and watched the farmer use a block and tackle to put hay in a barn. Since old Dobbin or the tractor did the hauling, there was no need for a fancy arrangement of ropes and blocks. Incidentally, you\u2019ll often hear the rope or tackle called the fall, block and tack, or block and fall. In the Navy you\u2019ll rig a block and tackle to make some of your work easier. Learn the names of the parts of a block. Figure 2-1 will give you a good start on this. Look at the single block and see some of the ways you can use it. If you lash a single block to a fixed object-an overhead, a yardarm, or a bulkhead-you give yourself the advantage of being able to pull from a convenient direction. For example, in figure 2-2 you haul up a flag hoist, but you really pull down. You can do this by having a single sheaved block made fast to the yardarm. This makes it possible for you to stand in a convenient place near the flag bag and do the job. Otherwise you would have to go aloft, dragging the flag hoist behind you.MECHANICAL ADVANTAGEWith a single fixed sheave, the force of your down pull on the fall must be equal to the weight of the object hoist. You can\u2019t use this rig to lift a heavy load or resistance with a small effort-you can change only the direction of your pull. A single fixed block is a first-class lever with equal arms. The arms (EF and FR) in figure 2-3 are equal; hence, the mechanical advantage is 1. When you pull down at A with a force of 1 pound, you raise a load of 1 pound at B. A single fixed block does not magnify force nor speed. You can, however, use a single block and fall to magnify the force you exert. Notice in figure 2-4 that the block is not fixed.The fall is doubled as it supports the 200-pound cask. When rigged this way, you call the single block and fall a runner. Each half of the fall carries one-half of the total bad, or 100 pounds. Thus, with the runner, the sailor is lifting a 200-pound cask with a 100-pound pull. The mechanical advantage is 2. Check this by the formula:The single movable block in this setup is a second-class lever. See figure 2-5. Your effort (E) acts upward upon the arm (EF), which is the diameter of the sheave. The resistance (R) acts downward on the arm (FR), which is the radius of the sheave. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the mechanical advantage is 2. When the effort at E moves up 2 feet, the load at R is raised only 1 foot. That\u2019s something to remember about blocks and falls\u2014if you are actually getting a mechanical advantage from the system. The length of rope that passes through your hands is greater than the distance that the load is raised. However, if you can lift a big load with a small effort, you don\u2019t care how much rope you have to pull. The sailor in figure 2-4 is in an awkward position to pull. If he had another single block handy, he could use it to change the direction of the pull, as in figure 2-6. This second arrangement is known as a gun tackle. Because the second block is fixed, it merely changes the direction of pull\u2014and the mechanical advantage of the whole system remains 2. You can arrange blocks in several ways, depending on the job to be done and the mechanical advantage you want to get.For example, a luff tack consists of a double block and a single block, rigged as in figure 2-7. Notice that the weight is suspended by the three parts of rope that extend from the movable single block. Each part of the rope carries its share of the load. If the crate weighs 600 pounds, then each of the three parts of the rope supports its share\u2014200 pounds. If there\u2019s a pull of 200 pounds downward on rope B, you will have to pull downward with a force of 200 pounds on A to counterbalance the pull on B. Neglecting the friction in the block, a pull of 200 pounds is all that is necessary to raise the crate. The mechanical advantage is:Here\u2019s a good tip. If you count the number of parts of rope going to and from the movable block you can figure the mechanical advantage at a glance. This simple rule will help you to approximate the mechanical advantage of most tackles you see in the Navy. Many combinations of single-, double-, and triplesheave blocks are possible. Two of these combinations are shown in figure 2-8. You can secure the dead end of the fall to the movable block. The advantage is increased by 1. Notice that this is done in figure 2-7. That is a good point to remember. Remember, also, that the strength of your fall\u2014rope\u2014is a limiting factor in any tackle. Be sure your fall will carry the load. There is no point in rigging a 6-fold purchase that carries a 5-ton load with two triple blocks on a 3-inch manila rope attached to a winch. The winch could take it, but the rope couldn\u2019t. Now for a review of the points you have learned about blocks, and then to some practical applications aboard ship: With a single fixed block the only advantage is the change of direction of the pull. The mechanical advantage is still 1. A single movable block gives a mechanical advantage of 2. Many combinations of single, double, and triple blocks can be rigged to give greater advantages. Remember that the number of parts of the fall going to and from the movable block tells you the approximate mechanical advantage of the tackle. If you fix the dead end of the fall to the movable block you increase the mechanical advantage by one 1.Additional information and explanation is available in the following,Basic Machines Training Course -US Navy(\"Block and Tackle\" excerpt, NAVEDTRA 14037, 1994)",
  "How a Wheel and Axle Works?": "Have you ever tried to open a door when the knob was missing? If you have, you know that trying to twist that small four-sided shaft with your fingers is tough work. That gives you some appreciation of the advantage you get by using a knob. The doorknob is an example of a simple machine called a wheel and axle. The steering wheel on an automobile, the handle of an ice cream freezer, and a brace and bit are all examples of a simple machine. All of these devices use the wheel and axle to multiply the force you exert. If you try to turn a screw with a screwdriver and it doesn\u2019t turn, stick a screwdriver bit in the chuck of a brace. The screw will probably go in with little difficulty. There\u2019s something you\u2019ll want to get straight right at the beginning. The wheel-and-axle machine consists of a wheel or crank rigidly attached to the axle, which turns with the wheel. Thus, the front wheel of an automobile is not a wheel-and-axle machine because the axle does not turn with the wheel.MECHANICAL ADVANTAGEHow does the wheel-and-axle arrangement help to magnify the force you exert? Suppose you use a screwdriver bit in a brace to drive a stubborn screw. Look at figure 3-1, view A. You apply effort on the handle that moves in a circular path, the radius of which is 5 inches. If you apply a 10-pound force on the handle, how much force will you exert against the resistance at the screw? Assume the radius of the screwdriver blade is 1/4 inch. You are really using the brace as a second-class lever\u2014see figure 3-1, view B. You can find the size of the resistance by using the formula:In that:Substituting in the formula and solving:This means that the screwdriver blade will turn the screw with a force of 200 pounds. The relationship between the radius of the diameters or the circumferences of the wheel and axle tells you how much mechanical advantage you can get. Take another situation. You raise the old oaken bucket, figure 3-2, using a wheel-and-axle arrangement. If the distance from the center of the axle to the handle is 8 inches and the radius of the drum around which the rope is wound is 2 inches, then you have a theoretical mechanical advantage of 4. That\u2019s why these rigs were used.MOMENT OF FORCEIn several situations you can use the wheel-and-axle to speed up motion. The rear-wheel sprocket of a bike, along with the rear wheel itself, is an example. When you are pedaling, the sprocket is attached to the wheel; so the combination is a true wheel-and-axle machine. Assume that the sprocket has a circumference of 8 inches, and the wheel circumference is 80 inches. If you turn the sprocket at a rate of one revolution per second, each sprocket tooth moves at a speed of 8 inches per second. Since the wheel makes one revolution for each revolution made by the sprocket, any point on the tire must move through a distance of 80 inches in 1 second. So, for every 8-inch movement of a point on the sprocket, you have moved a corresponding point on the wheel through 80 inches. Since a complete revolution of the sprocket and wheel requires only 1 second, the speed of a point on the circumference of the wheel is 80 inches per second, or 10 times the speed of a tooth on the sprocket. (NOTE: Both sprocket and wheel make the same number of revolutions per second, so the speed of turning for the two is the same.) Here is an idea that you will find useful in understanding the wheel and axle, as well as other machines. You probably have noticed that the force you apply to a lever starts to turn or rotate it about the fulcrum. You also know that a sheave on a fall starts to rotate the sheave of the block. Also when you turn the steering wheel of a car, it starts to rotate the steering column. Whenever you use a lever, or a wheel and axle, your effort on the lever arm or the rim of the wheel causes it to rotate about the fulcrum or the axle in one direction or another. If the rotation occurs in the same direction as the hands of a clock, we call that direction clockwise. If the rotation occurs in the opposite direction from that of the hands of a clock, we call that direction of rotation counterclockwise.A glance at figure 3-3 will make clear the meaning of these terms. The force acting on the handle of a carpenter\u2019s brace depends not only on the amount of that force, but also on the distance from the handle to the center of rotation. This is known as a moment of force, or a torque (pronounced tork). Moment of force and torque have the same meaning. Look at the effect of the counterclockwise movement of the capstan bar in figure 3-4. Here the amount of the effort is designated and the distance from the point where you apply the force to the center of the axle is L1Then, E1x L1is the moment of force. You\u2019ll notice that this term includes both the amount of the effort and the distance from the point of application of effort to the center of the axle. Ordinarily, you measure the distance in feet and the applied force in pounds. Therefore, you measure moments of force in footpounds (ft-lb). A moment of force is frequently called a moment. By using a longer capstan bar, the sailor in figure 3-4 can increase the effectiveness of his push without making a bigger effort. If he applied his effort closer to the head of the capstan and used the same force, the moment of force would be less.BALANCING MOMENTSYou know that the sailor in figure 3-4 would land flat on his face if the anchor hawser snapped. As long as nothing breaks, he must continue to push on the capstan bar. He is working against a clockwise moment of force that is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to his counterclockwise moment of force. The resisting moment, like the effort moment, depends on two factors. In the case of resisting moment, these factors are the force (R2) with which the anchor pulls on the hawser and the distance (L2) from the center of the capstan to its rim. The existence of this resisting force would be clear if the sailor let go of the capstan bar. The weight of the anchor pulling on the capstan would cause the whole works to spin rapidly in a clockwise direction\u2014and good-bye anchor! The principle involved here is that whenever the counterclockwise and the clockwise moments of force are in balance, the machine either moves at a steady speed or remains at rest. This idea of the balance of moments of force can be summed up by the expressionCLOCKWISE COUNTER = CLOCKWISE MOMENTS MOMENTS.Since a moment of force is the product of the amount of the force times the distance the force acts from the center of rotation, this expression of equality may be written:EXAMPLE 1:Put this formula to work on a capstan problem. You grip a single capstan bar 5 feet from the center of a capstan head with a radius of 1 foot. You have to lift a 1/2-ton anchor. How big of a push does the sailor have to exert? First, write down the formula:EXAMPLE 2:Consider now the sad case of Slim and Sam, as illustrated in figure 3-5. Slim has suggested that they carry the 300-pound crate slung on a handy 10-foot pole. He was smart enough to slide the load up 3 feet from Sam\u2019s shoulder. Here\u2019s how they made out. Use Slim\u2019s shoulder as a fulcrum (F1). Look at the clockwise movement caused by the 300-pound load. That load is 5 feet away from Slim\u2019s shoulder. If R1is the load, and L1the distance from Slim\u2019s shoulder to the load, the clockwise (MA) moment is:With Slim\u2019s shoulder still acting as the fulcrum, the resistance of Sam\u2019s effort causes a counterclockwise moment (MB)acting against the load moment. This counterclockwise moment is equal to Sam\u2019s effort (E2) times the distance (L3) from his shoulder to the fulcrum (F1) at Slim\u2019s shoulder. Since L2= 8 ft, the formula is:There is no rotation, so the clockwise moment and the counterclockwise moment are equal. MA = (MB) Hence:So poor Sam is carrying 187.5 pounds of the 330-pound load. What is Slim carrying? The difference between 300 and 187.5 = 112.5 pounds, of course! You can check your answer by the following procedure. This time, use Sam\u2019s shoulder as the fulcrum (F2). The counterclockwise moment (MC) is equal to the 300-pound load (R1) times the distance (L2= 3 feet) from Sam\u2019s shoulder. MC300 x 3 = 900 foot-pounds. The clockwise moment (MD) is the result of Slim\u2019s lift (E1) acting at a distance (L3) from the fulcrum. L3= 8 feet. Again, since counterclockwise moment equals clockwise moment, you have: 900 = E1x 8, andSlim, the smart sailor, has to lift only 112.5 pounds. There\u2019s a sailor who really puts his knowledge to work.THE COUPLETake a look at figure 3-6. It\u2019s another capstanturning situation. To increase an effective effort, place a second capstan bar opposite the first and another sailor can apply a force on the second bar. The two sailors in figure 3-6 will apparently be pushing in opposite directions. Since they are on opposite sides of the axle, they are actually causing rotation in the same direction. If the two sailors are pushing with equal force, the moment of force is twice as great as if only one sailor were pushing. This arrangement is known technically as a couple. You will see that the couple is a special example of the wheel and axle. The moment of force is equal to the product of the total distance (Ln) between the two points and the force (E1) applied by one sailor. The equation for the couple may be written:Additional information and explanation is available in the following,Basic Machines Training Course -US Navy(\"Wheel and Axle\" excerpt, NAVEDTRA 14037, 1994)",
  "How an Inclined Plane (Wedge) Works?": "You have probably watched a driver load barrels on a truck. He backs the truck up to the curb. The driver then places a long double plank or ramp from the sidewalk to the tailgate, and then rolls the barrel up the ramp. A 32-gallon barrel may weigh close to 300 pounds when full, and it would be a job to lift one up into the truck. Actually, the driver is using a simple machine called the inclined plane. You have seen the inclined plane used in many situations. Cattle ramps, a mountain highway and the gangplank are familiar examples. The inclined plane permits you to overcome a large resistance, by applying a small force through a longer distance when raising the load. Look at figure 4-1.Here you see the driver easing the 300-pound barrel up to the bed of the truck, 3 feet above the sidewalk. He is using a plank 9 feet long. If he didn\u2019t use the ramp at all, he\u2019d have to apply 300-pound force straight up through the 3-foot distance. With the ramp, he can apply his effort over the entire 9 feet of the plank as he rolls the barrel to a height of 3 feet. It looks as if he could use a force only three-ninths of 300, or 100 pounds, to do the job. And that is actually the situation.Here\u2019s the formula:In which L = length of the ramp, measured along the slope, 1 = height of the ramp, R = weight of the object to be raised, or lowered, E = force required to raise or lower the object. Now apply the formula this problem: In this case, L = 9ft, 1 = 3 ft, and R = 300 lb. By substituting these values in the formula, you get:Since the ramp is three times as long as its height, the mechanical advantage is three. You find the theoretical mechanical advantage by dividing the total distance of the effort you exert by the vertical distance the load is raised or lowered. THE WEDGE The wedge is a special application of the inclined plane. You have probably used wedges. Abe Lincoln used a wedge to help him split logs into rails for fences. The blades of knives, axes, hatchets, and chisels act as wedges when they are forced into apiece of wood. The wedge is two inclined planes set base-to-base. By driving the wedge full-length into the material to cut or split, you force the material apart a distance equal to the width of the broad end of the wedge. See figure 4-2. Long, slim wedges give high mechanical advantage. For example, the wedge of figure 4-2 has a mechanical advantage of six. The greatest value of the wedge is that you can use it in situations in which other simple machines won\u2019t work. Imagine the trouble you\u2019d have trying to pull a log apart with a system of pulleys.APPLICATIONS AFLOAT AND ASHOREA common use of the inclined plane in the Navy is the gangplank. Going aboard the ship by gangplank illustrated in figure 4-3, is easier than climbing a sea ladder.\u00a0 You appreciate the mechanical advantage of the gangplank even more when you have to carry your seabag or a case of sodas aboard. Remember that hatch dog in figure 1-10? The use of the dog to secure a door takes advantage of the lever principle. If you look sharply, you can see that the dog seats itself on a steel wedge welded to the door. As the dog slides upward along this wedge, it forces the door tightly shut. This is an inclined plane, with its length about eight times its thickness. That means you get a theoretical mechanical advantage of eight. In chapter 1, you figured that you got a mechanical advantage of four from the lever action of the dog. The overall mechanical advantage is 8 x 4, or 32, neglecting friction. Not bad for such a simple gadget, is it? Push down with 50 pounds heave on the handle and you squeeze the door shut with a force of 1,600 pounds on that dog. You\u2019ll find the damage-control parties using wedges by the dozen to shore up bulkheads and decks. A few sledgehammer blows on a wedge will quickly and firmly tighten up the shoring. Chipping scale or paint off steel is a tough job. How-ever, you can make the job easier with a compressed-air chisel. The wedge-shaped cutting edge of the chisel gets in under the scale or the paint and exerts a large amount of pressure to lift the scale or paint layer. The chisel bit is another application of the inclined plane.SUMMARYThe inclined plane is a simple machine that lets you raise or lower heavy objects by applying a small force over a long distance. You find the theoretical mechanical advantage of the inclined plane by dividing the length of the ramp by the perpendicular height of the load that is raised or lowered. The actual mechanical advantage is equal to the weight of the resistance or load, divided by the force that must be used to move the load up the ramp. The wedge is two inclined planes set base-to-base. It finds its greatest use in cutting or splitting materials.",
  "How a Screw Works?": "The screw is a simple machine that has many uses. The vise on a workbench makes use of the mechanical advantage (M.A.) of the screw. You get the same advantage using glued screw clamps to hold pieces of furniture together, a jack to lift an automobile, or a food processor to grind meat. A screw is a modification of the inclined plane. Cut a sheet of paper in the shape of a right triangle and you have an inclined plane. Wind this paper around a pencil, as in figure 5-1, and you can see that the screw is actually an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. As you turn the pencil, the paper is wound up so that its hypotenuse forms a spiral thread. The pitch of the screw and paper is the distance between identical points on the same threads measured along the length of the screw.THE JACKTo understand how the screw works, look at figure 5-2. Here you see the type of jack screw used to raise a house or apiece of heavy machinery. Notice that the jack has a lever handle; the length of the handle is equal to r.If you pull the lever handle around one turn, its outer end has described a circle. The circumference of this circle is equal to. (Remember thatequals 3.14, or 22/7).\u00a0 That is the distance you must apply the effort of the lever arm. At the same time, the screw has made one revolution, raising its height to equal its pitch (p).\u00a0 You might say that one full thread has come up out of the base. At any rate, the load has risen a distance p. Remember that the theoretical mechanical advantage (T.M.A.) is equal to the distance through which you apply the effort or pull, divided by the distance and resistance the load is moved. Assuming a 2-foot, or 24-inch, length for the lever arm and a 1/4-inch pitch for the thread, you can find the theoretical mechanical advantage by the formula:A 50-pound pull on the handle would result in a theoretical lift of 50 x 602 or about 30,000 pounds\u201415 tons for 50 pounds. However, jacks have considerable friction loss. The threads are cut so that the force used to overcome friction is greater than the force used to do useful work. If the threads were not cut this way and no friction were present, the weight of the load would cause the jack to spin right back down to the bottom as soon as you released the handle.THE MICROMETERIn using the jack you exerted your effort through a distance ofor 150 inches, to raise the screw 1/4 inch. It takes a lot of circular motion to get a small amount of straight line motion from the head of the jack. You will use this point to your advantage in the micrometer; it\u2019s a useful device for making accurate small measurements\u2014measurements of a few thousandths of an inch. In figure 5-3, you see a cutaway view of a micrometer.The thimble turns freely on the sleeve, rigidly attached to the micrometer frame. The spindle attaches to the thimble and is fitted with screw threads that move the spindle and thimble to the right or left in the sleeve when you rotate the thimble. These screw threads are cut 40 threads to the inch. Hence, one turn of the thimble moves the spindle and thimble 1/40 of inch. This represents one of the smallest divisions on the micrometer. Four of these small divisions make 4/40 of an inch, or 1/10 inch. Thus, the distance from 0 to 1 or 1 to 2 on the sleeve represents 1/10, or 0.1, inch. To allow even finer measurements, the thimble is divided into 25 equal parts. It is laid out by graduation marks around its rim, as shown in figure 5-4. If you turn the thimble through 25 of these equal parts, you have made one complete revolution of the screw. This represents a lengthwise movement of 1/40 of an inch. If you turn the thimble one of these units on its scale, you have moved the spindle a distance of 1/25 of 1/40 inch, or 1/1000 of an inch\u20140.001 inch. The micrometer in figure 5-4 reads 0.503 inch, that is the true diameter of the half-inch drill-bit shank measured. This tells you that the diameter of this bit is 0.003 inch greater than its nominal diameter of 1/2 inch\u20140.5000 inch. Because you can make accurate measurements with this instrument, it is vital in every machine shop.APPLICATIONS AFLOAT AND ASHOREIt\u2019s a tough job to pull a rope or cable tight enough to get all the slack out of it. However, you can do it by using a turnbuckle. The turnbuckle (fig, 5-5) is an application of the screw. If you turn it in one direction, it takes up the slack in a cable. Turning it the other way allows slack in the cable. Notice that one bolt of the turnbuckle has left-hand threads and the other bolt has right-hand threads. Thus, when you turn the turnbuckle to tighten the line, both bolts tighten up. If both bolts were right-hand threadstandard thread-one would tighten while the other one loosened an equal amount. That would result in no change in cable slack. Most turnbuckles have the screw threads cut to provide a large amount of frictional resistance to keep the turnbuckle from unwinding under load. In some cases, the turnbuckle has a locknut on each of the screws to prevent slipping. You\u2019ll find turnbuckles used in a hundred different ways afloat and ashore. Ever wrestled with a length of wire rope? Obstinate and unwieldy, wasn\u2019t it? Riggers have dreamed up tools to help subdue wire rope. One of these tools-the rigger\u2019s vise-is shown in figure 5-6. This rigger\u2019s vise uses the mechanical advantage of the screw to hold the wire rope in place. The crew splices a thimble-a reinforced loop\u2014onto the end of the cable. Rotating the handle causes the jaw on that screw to move in or out along its grooves. This machine is a modification of the vise on a workbench. Notice the right-hand and left-hand screws on the left-hand clamp. Figure 5-7 shows you another use of the screw. Suppose you want to stop a winch with its load suspended in mid-air.To do this, you need a brake. The brakes on most anchor or cargo winches consist of a metal band that encircles the brake drum. The two ends of the band fasten to nuts connected by a screw attached to a handwheel. As you turn the handwheel, the screw pulls the lower end of the band (A) up toward its upper end (B). The huge mechanical advantage of the screw puts the squeeze on the drum, and all rotation of the drum stops. One type of steering gear used on many small ships and as a spare steering system on some larger ships is the screw gear. Figure 5-8 shows you that the wheel turns a long threaded shaft. Half the threads\u2014 those nearer the wheel end of this shaft-are right-hand threads. The other half of the threads-those farther from the wheel\u2014are left-hand threads. Nut A has a right-hand thread, and nut B has a left-hand thread. Notice that two steering arms connect the crosshead to the nuts; the crosshead turns the rudder. If you stand in front of the wheel and turn it in a clockwise direction\u2014 to your right\u2014arm A moves forward and arm B moves backward. That turns the rudder counterclockwise, so the ship swings in the direction you turn the wheel. This steering mechanism has a great mechanical advantage. Figure 5-9 shows you another practical use of the screw.\u00a0 The quadrant davit makes it possible for two men to put a large lifeboat over the side with little effort. The operating handle attaches to a threaded screw that passes through a traveling nut. Cranking the operating handle in a counterclockwise direction (as you face outboard), the nut travels outward along the screw. The traveling nut fastens to the davit arm by a swivel. The davit arm and the boat swing outboard as a result of the outward movement of the screw. The thread on that screw is the self-locking type; if you let go of the handle, the nut remains locked in position.SUMMARYYou have learned the following basic information about the screw from this chapter; now notice the different ways the Navy uses this simple machine: The screw is a modification of the inclined plane\u2014 modified to give you a high mechanical advantage. The theoretical mechanical advantage of the screw can be found by the formula:As in all machines, the actual mechanical advantage equals the resistance divided by the effort. In many applications of the screw, you make use of the large amount of friction that is commonly present in this simple machine. By using the screw, you reduce large amounts of circular motion to very small amounts of straight-line motion.",
  "How Gears Work?": "Did you ever take a clock apart to see what made it tick? Of course you came out with some parts left over when you got it back together again. And they probably included a few gear wheels. We use gears in many machines. Frequently the gears are hidden from view in a protective case filled with grease or oil, and you may not see them. An eggbeater gives you a simple demonstration of the three jobs that gears do. They can change the direction of motion, increase or decrease the speed of the applied motion, and magnify or reduce the force that you apply. Gears also give you a positive drive. There can be, and usually is, creep or slip in a belt drive. However, gear teeth are always in mesh, so there can be no creep and slip. Follow the directional changes in figure 6-1.The crank handle turns in the direction shown by the arrow\u2014clockwise\u2014when viewed from the right. The 32 teeth on the large vertical wheel (A) mesh with the 8 teeth on the right-hand horizontal wheel (B), which rotates as shown by the arrow. Notice that as B turns in a clockwise direction, its teeth mesh with those of wheel C and cause wheel C to revolve in the opposite direction. The rotation of the crank handle has been transmitted by gears to the beater blades, which also rotate. Now figure out how the gears change the speed of motion. There are 32 teeth on gear A and 8 teeth on gear B. However, the gears mesh, so that one complete revolution of A results in four complete revolutions of gear B. And since gears B and C have the same number of teeth, one revolution of B results in one revolution of C. Thus, the blades revolve four times as fast as the crank handle. In chapter 1 you learned that third-class levers increase speed at the expense of force. The same happens with the eggbeater. The magnitude of force changes. The force required to turn the handle is greater than the force applied to the frosting by the blades. This results in a mechanical advantage of less than one.TYPES OF GEARSWhen two shafts are not lying in the same straight line, but are parallel, you can transmit motion from one to the other by spur gears. This setup is shown in figure 6-2. Spur gears are wheels with mating teeth cut in their surfaces so that one can turn the other without slippage. When the mating teeth are cut so that they are parallel to the axis of rotation, as shown in figure 6-2, the gears are called straight spur gears. When two gears of unequal size are meshed together, the smaller of the two is usually called a pinion. By unequal size, we mean an unequal number of teeth causing one gear to be a larger diameter than the other. The teeth, themselves, must be of the same size to mesh properly. The most commonly used gears are the straight spur gears. Often you\u2019ll run across another type of spur gear called the helical spur gear. In helical gears the teeth are cut slantwise across the working face of the gear. One end of the tooth, therefore, lies ahead of the other. Thus, each tooth has a leading end and a trailing end. Figure 6-3, view A, shows you the construction of these gears. In the straight spur gears, the whole width of the teeth comes in contact at the same time. However, with helical (spiral) gears, contact between two teeth starts first at the leading ends and moves progressively across the gear faces until the trailing ends are in contact. This kind of meshing action keeps the gears in constant contact with one another. Therefore, less lost motion and smoother, quieter action is possible.One disadvantage of this helical spur gear is the tendency of each gear to thrust or push axially on its shaft. It is necessary to put a special thrust bearing at the end of the shaft to counteract this thrust. You do not need thrust bearings if you use herringbone gears like those shown in figure 6-4. Since the teeth on each half of the gear are cut in opposite directions, each half of the gear develops a thrust that counterbalances the other half. You\u2019ll find herringbone gears used mostly on heavy machinery. Figure 6-3, views B, C, and D, also shows you three other gear arrangements in common use. The internal gear in figure 6-3, view B, has teeth on the inside of a ring, pointing inward toward the axis of rotation. An internal gear is meshed with an external gear, or pinion, whose center is offset from the center of the internal gear. Either the internal or pinion gear can be the driver gear, and the gear ratio is calculated the same as for other gears\u2014by counting teeth. You only need a portion of a gear where the motion of the pinion is limited. You use the sector gear shown in figure 6-3, view C, to save space and material. The rack and pinion in figure 6-3, view D, are both spur gears. The rack is a piece cut from a gear with an extremely large radius. The rack-and-pinion arrangement is useful in changing rotary motion into linear motion.THE BEVEL GEARSo far most of the gears you\u2019ve learned about transmit motion between parallel shafts. However, when shafts are not parallel (at an angle), we use another type of gear called the bevel gear. This type of gear can connect shafts lying at any given angle because you can bevel them to suit the angle. Figure 6-5, view A, shows a special case of the bevel gear-the miter gear. You use the miter gears to connect shafts having a 90-degree angle; that means the gear faces are beveled at a 45-degree angle. You can see in figure 6-5, view B, how bevel gears are designed to join shafts at any angle. Gears cut at any angle other than 45 degrees are bevel gears. The gears shown in figure 6-5 are straight bevel gears, because the whole width of each tooth comes in contact with the mating tooth at the same time. However, you\u2019ll run across spiral bevel gears with teeth cut to have advanced and trailing ends. Figure 6-6 shows you what spiral bevel gears look like. They have the same advantage as other spiral (helical) gears\u2014less lost motion and smoother, quieter operation.THE WORM AND WORM WHEELFigure 6-7.\u2014Worm gears. Worm and worm-wheel combinations, like those in figure 6-7, have many uses and advantages. However, it\u2019s better to understand their operating theory before learning of their uses and advantages. Figure 6-7, view A, shows the action of a single-thread worm. For each revolution of the worm, the worm wheel turns one tooth. Thus, if the worm wheel has 25 teeth, the gear ratio is 25:1.Figure 6-7, view B, shows a double-thread worm. For each revolution of the worm in this case, the worm wheel turns two teeth. That makes the gear ratio 25:2 if the worm wheel has 25 teeth. A triple-thread worm would turn the worm wheel three teeth per revolution of the worm. A worm gear is a combination of a screw and a spur gear. You can obtain remarkable mechanical advantages with this arrangement. You can design worm drives so that only the worm is the driver-the spur cannot drive the worm. On a hoist, for example, you can raise or lower the load by pulling on the chain that turns the worm. If you let go of the chain, the load cannot drive the spur gear; therefore, it lets the load drop to the deck. This is a nonreversing worm drive.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Simple Machines:": "The Mechanical Advantage of a Lever is the the length of the Effort Arm divided by the length of Resistance Arm.The Mechanical Advantage of a Block and Tackle (Pulley): count the number of ropes going to and from the movable block (that gives you the mechanical advantage at a glance).",
  "What are the Basics of Structural Analysis?": "To understand how structures work, a few basic concepts must beexplained. A structure must be designed to resist the likely forces it will encounter andnot fail or deflect too much. The common forces are snow load, wind load, earthquake load,dead load (the actual weight of the structure itself) and live load (people or storedmaterials). The building code generally sets the limits for those various design loads.But the best place to begin an understanding of simple structuralanalysis isn\u2019t in the building codes and the stipulated loads, but in knowing howsimple structural elements work and fail.An additional reference for understanding structural loads can be found in theUS Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) STRUCTURAL LOAD DATA (UFC 3-310-01 - 25 May 2005).",
  "How Axial Force Crushes?": "Columns and posts are defined as vertical structural elements. Acolumn or post transfers load from a roof or a floor down to a foundation. For a simplecolumn, most of that load is an axial force that transfers downward. That axial force(which may be caused by snow, dead and live load) will be described in pounds or kips(thousands of pounds). It\u2019s easy to imagine a column, say a wood 6 x 6 under a woodoutside deck, with an axial load. That load puts the column in compression. See Figure3.1Axial Forces.",
  "How Tension Force Pulls?": "A steel cable attached to a cable winch illustrates tension forcequite well. As the cable winch is tightened, the steel cable stretches tighter. Thetension stress in the steel cable increases (and the sag in the steel cable gets to beless and less). At the allowable tension design stress, say 30,000 psi (depending on thesteel type) the cable will be fully loaded. If more tension force is applied with thecable winch, at some higher stress level the steel yield strength will be reached and thecable will snap.",
  "How Shear Force Tears?": "A beam carries load (usually horizontally) from floors and roofs tocolumns. A simple beam must be designed to resist both shear and bending moments. Shearcan be illustrated by tearing open a potato chip bag. As your hands grip the bag and pullin opposite directions, the bag starts to tear in a shear failure. To open the bag usingtension, you would grip either end of the bag and pull along a line, but in oppositedirections. It would be quite difficult to open a potato chip bag using tension, and thechips would fly all over the floor. On the other hand, trying to open that bag using axialforce (compression) would only smash the chips.Shear stress in a beam goes to failure along a plane, perpendicularto the beam, in which the load side of the beam displaces downward. See Figure3.2 Shearfor an illustration.It\u2019s important to understand that shear failures tend to happenquickly, without much notice or warning (i.e. not much movement, creaking, deflection,etc.). Therefore building codes tend to require a higher factor of safety against shearfailures when stipulating the allowable stresses.",
  "How Bending Moments, well, Bend?": "A simple beam that works to carry the shear stress must also bedesigned for the bending moment. Think of a scaffold plank, a 2 x 10 piece of woodspanning 6\u2019. As you step onto the middle of the scaffold plank, you notice somedeflection downward. The scaffold plank is now experiencing a bending moment. If you thinkabout the actual plank directly under your feet, the wood fibers on the bottom of theplank are in tension, they are being pulled apart as the plank bends downward. The woodfibers on top of the scaffolding plank are in compression, they are being pushed together.You can visualize this effect by holding your right handoutstretched, palm facing upward. Take the index finger of your left hand and poke downinto the middle of your right palm. Cup your right hand just a bit. Now you get a visualof a bending moment. The skin on the bottom of your hand (around your knuckles) is intension\u2026the skin is being stretched tight. The skin in your palm, right near theapplied load of your index finger, is in compression\u2026the skin is bunching together.Figure 1.4 illustrates.This concept of bending is important to understand. The scaffoldplank acts as a beam, which is under load and is resisting the bending moment. Considerthe cross section of the beam (i.e. the scaffold plank) at the point of load (where youare standing). When a structural element is being loaded in bending, the deflection, evenif only a small amount, causes tension in the lowest fibers of the beam and compression inthe top fibers. The failure due to bending moment occurs as the beam deflects and eitherthe bottom fibers pull apart and fail in tension or the top fibers crush and fail incompression. This is illustrated in Figure 1.3 Bending Moment.The shape of a steel \u201cI\u201d beam follows from thisunderstanding of bending moments. Since the extreme stress in tension is at the bottom ofthe member and the extreme stress in compression is at the top of the member, a regularrectangular shape would have most of its area under low stress. Only the very top and verybottom would be under maximum stress. Figure 1.5 shows how a rectangular shape and an\u201cI\u201d beam might be stressed. Obviously, since the steel rectangle beam weighs 97lbs/foot and the W12x45 \u201cI\u201d beam weighs 45 lbs/foot, the steel \u201cI\u201dbeam is much more efficient to use.",
  "How Torsion Twists?": "Though not as common in most structural elements as axial and tensionforces, shear and bending moments, torsion should also be understood. A lintel above adoorway acts as a good illustration for torsion. Say the lintel is a steel beam withconcrete block laid directly on top of the beam. That steel beam, then, must be designedfor shear and bending moment, but it has no torsion. All the load is coming down directlyon top of the steel beam and transferring directly down through the concrete block wallson either side of the door.If the steel beam has a \ufffd\u201d steel plate welded onto the bottomthat sticks out 6\u201d to carry a wythe of brick off to the side, as well as the concreteblock directly overhead, then that beam will see torsion. The force from the brick willtry to twist that steel beam. That force is torsion and it must be considered whenever aload is applied off to one side of the center of the member.",
  "What are the 3 Basic Types of Connections?": "Beams, columns, joists and trusses all connect, both to each otherand eventually to some type of foundation. On a construction site, these structuralelements get connected in many different ways: a wood beam bolts to a steel girder, asteel joist welds to a steel beam, a steel beam is buried into a massive concretefoundation. To simplify structural design and analysis, though, all the many differenttypes of connections are grouped in three basic categories: roller, pinned and fixed.The roller connection resists vertical forces only. Think of a steelbeam sitting, on bolted, with 8 inches bearing on a 12\u201d concrete wall. If a verticalforce is applied to the steel beam, it will resist, the beam can\u2019t move down throughthe wall. If a horizontal force is applied to the beam, on the other hand, the beam caneasily slide further onto the wall. If the other end of the beam is lowered, the beambearing on the concrete wall can easily pivot. Therefore, the roller connection resistsvertical loads, but not horizontal loads or moments, as shown in the figure below.The pin connection resists both vertical and horizontal forces. Thepin connection shown in the figure above clearly illustrates how a beam could connect to asupport. Both roller and pin connections are called simple supports, because they don\u2019tresist moments.Fixed supports, on the other hand, do resist moments. The figure aboveshows an example of a steel beam with the bearing end buried in a concrete wall. Sincetheir can\u2019t be any twisting or moving of the steel beam that is buried in theconcrete, that connection resists any moment.Most connections in construction are assumed to be simple supports(roller and pin connections) because the reality of getting a connection to resist amoment is challenging. A steel beam bolted to a steel column with angle clips on eitherside (photo) is assumed to be a pinned connection, even though a bit of moment resistancewould occur. Similarly, almost any wood member nailed or bolted to another wood member islikely to be a pinned connection because of the difficulty of transferring moment throughthat connection.Moment connection usually are clearly stipulated on sets of drawingsand shown how to be obtained. The photo shows the welded steel plate on the top and bottomflanges of the beam to the column that transfers the moment. When connecting structuralelements, you should consider if the connection can be a simple support or needs to be afixed (moment resisting) connection.",
  "What is a Stable and Unstable Structure?": "One of the big advantages of understanding the basics of loads,connections and structural elements is the ability to determine stable and unstablestructures. A stable structure has the proper combination of structural members, shape andconnections. A stable structure resists loads and stays in place with minimal deflection.An unstable structure fails, not from structural members failing due to over-stress, butfrom the unsoundness of the geometry and the connection types. The figure below illustrates.Many times temporary structures are built on a job site that areunstable and dangerous. Too often the person building the temporary structure simply doesn\u2019tunderstand the importance of including diagonal bracing or fixed supports to make thestructure stable.Make it a habit to look at structural systems and determine wheretheir stability comes from. The advanced level of understanding that will arise frompaying attention to building structures will help you to see problems before they causefailures. Whether building a cabinet or a large building, the basics of structural designapply.",
  "What Should I Know about Expansion and Contraction?": "In the world of construction the proper consideration of the factors of expansion and contraction is oftenmissed. A survey of existing buildings tends to show wall cracks near columns and cracksin the floor. The Design Professional must detail the project to consider expansion andcontraction of materials. The best Design Professional always do, but many neglect thisimportant area. Since the Construction Supervisor will have to explain the cracks or bulges at thecompletion of the project, he should review the drawings at the onset and feel satisfiedthat the construction details will allow the building to move appropriately. One doesn\u2019tneed an engineering degree to review these details, common sense is by far thebest guide. Incidentally, if no review is performed and building does crack or bulge, myexperience shows it is very hard to convince a group of people looking at the problem thatit is not inferior workmanship and the Contractor\u2019s responsibility. It is alwaysdifficult to explain the workings of expansion and contraction.There areseveral forces at work in concrete causing expansion and contraction. Shrinkage occurs in concrete due to excess water in the mix. Shrinkage occurs in concrete at a decreasing rate for many years. After90 days the average concrete shrinkage is 60% and after 1 year approximately 80% per the American Concrete Institute references. Interestingly, if the dry concrete were flooded with water, it wouldexpand to near the original volume.Temperaturecontractiontends to shorten the concrete during cold weather. It is an interesting side note that reinforced concrete only works because steel and concrete react to temperature changes in an almost identical manner. If they react differently, temperature variations would tear reinforced concrete apart. Temperature Expansionallows concrete to grow in high temperatures. These expansion and contraction forces mustbe considered in the concrete work.By way ofexample, let\u2019s examine a concrete slab on grade. If the concrete floor were to stayat a constant temperature its entire life, the concrete would occupy the largest volumeright at the time of hydration (hardening). From that time, the concrete will continue toshrink due to to water evaporation. Therefore, in normal building, where temperature swingis minimized, concrete contraction will always be the main concern. However, if thisconcrete slab were part of a large driveway outside the high summer temperatures couldexpand the concrete to greater than its initial size and necessitate expansion joints.Another methodfor dealing with contraction problems in concrete is to utilize shrinkage-compensatingconcrete. This special design mix both shrinks (like normal concrete) and expands toprovide a concrete that has greatly reduced shrinkage. The extra cost for this concretewill typically be the Owner\u2019s decision.Expansion andcontraction should be considered in all materials for a building project. But specialattention should be paid to the concrete work. Because of its low tension strength,concrete will crack much sooner than steel or aluminum. An awareness of expansion andcontraction goes a long way in avoiding potential problems.",
  "What Should I Know about Creep and Fatigue?": "Simply defined, Creep is permanent deformation (Deflection) of astructural member under the normal working load. For example, a concrete beam will deflectimmediately under its working load, so a concrete floor slab will deflect under its ownweight and the weight of the furniture and people setting on it. Over the next 2-5 years,though, the concrete beam will continue to creep under the same load. This additiondeflection due to creep can be three times the magnitude of the initial deflection.If the load on the member is increased over time, the immediatestructural deflection and associated creep will continue to increase. It is important forthe Construction Supervisor to realize that creep is a significant happening in concrete members.The other important concept is that of fatigue, defined asfluctuating loading which leads a structural member to fracture. Consider a concrete beamin a bridge, when a truck drives across the bridge the beam is stressed and then the loadis removed. Fatigue is often considered as the material strength after 2,00,000 cycles ofloading. When working on an older concrete building, it is helpful to keep the concepts ofcreep and fatigue in mind.",
  "How Do I Learn to Read Blueprints?": "My high school physics said the language of science is mathematics. Since I never spoke that language too well, I wasn\u2019t much of a scientist. I\u2019ve been an effective contractor, though, and have learned the language of construction: drawings. We communicate in job trailers by pointing to the significant sections of drawings. We make sketches, often quite rough, to show what we\u2019re trying to say.In short, if you want to advance in construction, learn to read drawings well and to make rough sketches. It\u2019s a simple language to learn (I\u2019m the least visual person I know and I learned it), but it does take some studying.So, how do you learn to read blueprints?It's a little like eating elephants. You might ask me, \"How do you eat an elephant?\" The answer, of course, is \"One bite at a time.\"Novice blueprint readers look at the entire page of words, lines and weird symbols and get overwhelmed. It's easy at that point for your brain to shut down and you just say, \"I can't read blueprints.\" If you tried to read an entire page of words at the same time, you couldn't do that either. You simply have to calm down, start at one corner and begin figuring out what you can learn from the blueprint. The main difference between a blueprint and a page of text is that you know to start at the top left corner on a page of text, then to left to right till the bottom of the page. Blueprints don't have a place you need to start.So where should you start?",
  "Why Should I Think \"Plan, Elevation and Section\"?": "The most basic concept about reading blueprints, and the one to keep in mind no matter how good you get at reading blueprints, is \"Plan, Elevation and Section\". Your first thought when looking a drawing should be, \"Is this a Plan, an Elevation or a Section?\" First, some quick definitions:Plan: a view looking downward on the object, usually the horizontal plane cut at 30\" above the floor.Elevation: a view looking sideways at the object, usually from the north, the west, the south or the east.Section: a cut-through view of the object, usually an imaginary view that shows how something will be built.When I'm standing in a job trailer, and we are trying to resolve some problem and someone starts drawing a sketch, my first question almost always is, \"Are you drawing a plan view, a side view or a section view?\" I know many people don't ask that question and often just looks at lines on the paper, having no idea what the sketcher is trying to\u00a0 convey. Learn to ask that question first, whether you are looking at a new set of blueprints or a sketch done by a friend.The rest of the information below will help you understand some other specific aspects of understanding blueprints. The most important thing to remember, though, is just to do one thing at a time. Don't try to understand everything at once, no one can do that, so you won't be able to either. Take some time, relax, look at each symbol and word and try to understand what it's there for. Most everything on a blueprint is there for a purpose, so just slowly go through the symbols and words, getting their purpose into your head.I often go through a new set of blueprints on a project with a yellow highlighter, reading and highlighting every word, number or symbol. When I've highlighted an entire sheet, I've got a fairly clear idea of what the designer and draftsman were trying to convey.",
  "What is an Architectural Scale?": "We use an Architect's Scale when dimensions or measurements are to be expressed in feet and inches. So the gradations on an Architect's Scale are as follows:1/8\" = 1'1/4\" = 1'1/2\" = 1'1\" = 1'3/8\" = 1'3/4\" = 1'1 1/2\" = 1'3\" = 1'3/32\" = 1'3/16\" = 1'Regular inch scale with\u00a0 gradations to the 16th of an inch",
  "What is an Engineering Scale?": "We use an Engineer's Scale whenever dimensions are in feet and decimal parts of a foot, or when the scale ratio is a multiple of 10. So an Engineer's Scale has an inch broken into 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 gradations.",
  "Why Specs Should be Read?": "The most boring part of Construction Supervision may be reading Specs and General Conditions. So lots of folks just don't do it. They make that decision lightly, but the ramifications can be huge. Too many times Design Professionals hide little time-bombs in the Specs, or Special Conditions, that become important as the project progresses.Perhaps it's a milestone in the schedule that must be achieved by a certain date. Or a requirement to never work before 8am in the morning or on weekends. Sometimes the project clean-up requirements can be quite different from what might make sense to you, but those are the rules for that project.So at the start of a project, the Construction Supervisor should obtain his or her own copy of all the project documents and read them. After doing this on a couple of projects, you will learn what you can skim through and what needs more careful attention. Don't just blow off this duty, though.The Project Specifications, General Conditions, Special Conditions and Construction Contracts constitute the rules for the project. It's easier to win the game when you know the rules.",
  "Why aren't CAD Drawings all Done in 3D?": "Blueprints traditionally got drawn as two dimensional (2D) drawings. Architects and Engineers drew in 2D because 3D was too complicated. When Computed Aided Design (CAD) became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, we assumed most drawings would now get drawn in 3D. But they don't. Things tend to change slowly in the design and construction industry. The typical set of plans produces today don't vary that much from plans produced generations ago.So why aren't most projects designed in 3D? I believe most Design Professionals are proficient at producing 2D drawings, but often don't understand the details of how contractors build buildings. As a young Design Professional working in a Design Office, I know I didn't.So the complexity of producing 3D drawings carries the task of actually knowing how the project will be built. The level of understanding must be much higher for the draftsman. The technology works, but the learning curve for the Design Professionals is steep. On the other hand, many Owners try to limit their design costs and don't feel 3D drawings would add enough value to cover the cost of production of the documents.The current state of affairs, then, has most projects being built on 2D drawings. The more complex projects, though, increasingly use 3D for architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical. Perhaps the main advantage of 3D is the crash feature. By modeling all the elements, the hundreds of crashes between beams, columns, ducts, pipes and the many other features in a building can be determined during design, then resolved in the office rather than in the field, with crews standing and waiting.The future will belong to 3D...it's just not clear how long it will take for us to get there.",

  "What Should I Know about Tools?": "An excellent tradesperson prizes his or her tools. Those tools increase the value of the worker. I've rarely seen a skilled tradesman who didn't take care of his tools. BY having the right tool and knowing who to use it, we multiply our ability to get the work done well and quickly.Lots of detailed information regarding tools and their uses can be obtained from the US Navy's Training Course (Tools and Their Uses, NAVEDTRA 14256, June 1992).",

  "Why this Simple Loan Payment Calculator is so helpful?": "I'm surprised how many times I've looked smart (and gotten a reasonably accurate, quick answer) by knowing this easy way to approximate a loan monthly payment. We might be standing, speaking with the Owner on a factory project and he mentions that the change we are discussing will cost about $100,000. Now I know that a 20 year loan at 8% has a monthly payment multiplication factor of 0.8%. So 1% of $100,000 would be $1,000. Therefore, 0.8% would be $800.

You need to pay attention to the range of interest rates for the projects you work on and can usually assume that banks mostly do 20 year mortgages. So with interest low at this time, I'd probably just remember that 20 year loan at 6% has a multiplication factor of about 0.7%. So if an Owner does a $2,000,000 project, the monthly payment will be $14,000.Just remember that loans include only the loan amount, the term (years) and the interest rate (annual percentage rate).

  "Introduction": "The following information has been provided by the Department of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, titled Operational Medicine 2001 Standard First Aid Course (NAVEDTRA 13119US).First aid is the emergency care and treatment of a sick or injured person before professional medical services are obtained. FIRST AID MEASURES ARE NOT MEANT TO REPLACE PROPER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, but will only consist of providing temporary support until professional medical assistance is available. The purposes of first aid are (1) to save life, (2) prevent further injury, and (3) to minimize or prevent infection.While administering first aid, the three primary objectives are (1) to maintain an open airway, (2) maintain breathing, and (3) to maintain circulation. During this process you will also control bleeding, and reduce or prevent shock.You must respond rapidly, stay calm, and think before you act. Do not waste time looking for ready-made materials, do the best you can with what is at hand. Request professional medical assistance as soon as possible.Initial AssessmentWhen responding to a casualty, take a few seconds to quickly inspect the area. Remain calm as you take charge of the situation, and act quickly but efficiently. Decide as soon as possible what has to be done and which one of the injuries needs attention first. During your initial assessment, consider the following:1.Safety- Determine if the area is safe. If the situation is such that you or the casualty is in danger, you must consider this threat against the possible damage caused by early movement. If you decide to move the casualty, do it quickly and gently to a safe area where proper first aid can be given. You cannot help the casualty if you become one yourself.2.Mechanism of injury- Determine the extent of the illness or injury and how it happened. If the casualty is unconscious, look for clues. If the casualty is lying at the bottom of a ladder, suspect that he or she fell and may have internal injuries.3.Medical information devices- Examine the casualty for a MEDIC ALERT necklace, bracelet, or identification card. This medical tag, provides medical conditions, medications being taken, and allergies about the casualty. The VIAL OF LIFE, a small, prescription-type bottle, also contains medical information concerning the casualty. This bottle is normally located in the refrigerator.4.Number of casualties- Look beyond the first casualty, you may find others. One casualty may be alert, while another, more serious or unconscious, is unnoticed. In a situation with more than one casualty limit your assessment to looking for an open airway, breathing, bleeding, and circulation, the life-threatening conditions.5.Bystanders- Ask bystanders to help you find out what happened. Though not trained in first aid, bystanders can help by calling for professional medical assistance, providing emotional support to the casualty, and keeping onlookers from getting in the way.6.Introduce yourself- Inform the casualty and bystanders who you are and that you know first aid. Prior to rendering first aid, obtain the casualties consent by asking is it \"OK' to help them. Consent is implied if the casualty is unconscious or cannot reply.General RulesEvery illness or injury presents with its own individual problems. Prior to learning first aid for a specific illness or injury, you must have a complete understanding of the following:1. Keep the casualty lying down, head level with the body, until you determine the extent and seriousness of the illness or injury. You must immediately recognize if the casualty has one of the following conditions that represent an exception to the above.a. Vomiting or bleeding around the mouth - If the casualty is vomiting or bleeding around the mouth, place themon their side, or back with head turned to the side.Special care must be taken for a casualty with asuspected neck or back injury.b. Difficulty breathing - If the casualty has a chest injury or difficulty breathing place them in a sitting or semisitting position.c. Shock - To reduce or prevent shock, place the casualty on his or her back, with their legs elevated 6 to 12inches.If you suspect head or neck injuries or are unsure of the casualty's condition, keep them lyingflat and wait for professional medical assistance.2. During your examination, move the casualty no more than is necessary. Loosen restrictive clothing, at the neck, waist, and where it binds. Carefully remove only enough clothing to get a clear idea of the extent of the injuries. When necessary, cut clothing along its seams. Ensure the casualty does not become chilled, and keep them as comfortable as possible. Inform the casualty of what you are doing and why. Respect the casualty's modesty, but do not jeopardize quality care. Shoes may have to be cut off to avoid causing pain or further injury.3. Reassure the casualty that his or her injuries are understood and that professional medical assistance will arrive as soon as possible. The casualty can tolerate pain and discomfort better if they are confident in your abilities.4. Do not touch open wounds or burns with your fingers or un-sterile objects unless it is absolutely necessary.Place a barrier between you and the casualty's blood or body fluids, using plastic wrap, gloves, or a clean, folded cloth. Wash your hands with soap and warm water immediately after providing care, even if you wore gloves or used another barrier.5.Do not give the casualty anything to eat or drinkbecause it may cause vomiting, and because of the possible need for surgery. If the casualty complains of thirst, wet his or her lips with a wet towel.6. Splint all suspected, broken or dislocated bones in the position in which they are found.Do not attempt to straighten broken or dislocated bonesbecause of the high risk of causing further injury. Do not move the casualty if you do not have to.7. When transporting, carry the casualtyfeet first. This enables the rear bearer to observe the casualty for any complications.8. Keep the casualty comfortable and warm enough to maintain normal body temperature.Infectious DiseasesYou will probably render first aid to someone you know - a shipmate or family member. For this reason you will probably know your risk of contracting an infectious disease. Adopt practices that discourage the spread of blood-borne diseases (Hepatitis and HIV) and air-borne diseases such as influenza when performing first aid.1. Wear gloves or use another barrier.2. Wash your hands with soap and warm water immediately.3. When possible, use a pocket mask or mouthpiece during rescue breathing.The risk of contracting infections from a casualty is very remote. Do not withhold rendering first aid because of this rare possibility.",
  "Basic Life Support": "Atmospheric air that is essential for life contains approximately 21% oxygen. When you breathe in (inhale) only a quarter of the air is taken by the blood in the lungs. The air you breath out (exhale) contains approximately 16% oxygen. Enough to support life! Seconds after being deprived of oxygen, the heart is at risk of developing irregular beats or stopping. Within four to six minutes, the brain is subject to irreversible damage.Basic life support is maintenance of the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) without auxiliary equipment. The primary importance is placed on establishing and maintaining an adequate openairway. Airway obstruction alone may be the emergency: a shipmate begins choking on a piece of food. Restorebreathingto reverse respiratory arrest (stopped breathing) commonly caused by electric shock, drowning, head injuries, and allergic reactions. Restorecirculationto keep blood circulating and carrying oxygen to the heart, lungs, brain, and body.This course is not a substitute for formal training in basic life support.Airway ObstructionAirway obstruction, also known as choking, occurs when the airway (route for passage of air into and out of the lungs) becomes blocked.The restoration of breathing takes precedence over all other measures.. The reason for this is simple: If a casualty cannot breathe, he or she cannot live. Individuals who are choking may stop breathing and become unconscious. The universally recognized distress signal (Fig. 2-1) for choking is the casualty clutching at his or her throat with one or both hands. The most common causes of airway obstruction are swallowing large pieces of improperly chewed food, drinking alcohol before or during meals, and laughing while eating. The tongue is the most common cause of obstruction in the casualty who is unconscious. A foreign body can cause a partial or complete airway obstruction.Partial Airway ObstructionIf the casualty can cough forcefully, and is able to speak, there is good air exchange. Encourage him or her to continue coughing in an attempt to dislodge the object. Do not interfere with the casualty's efforts to remove the obstruction. First aid for a partial airway obstruction is limited to encouragement and observation. When good air exchange progresses to poor air exchange, demonstrated by a weak or ineffective cough, a high-pitched noise when inhaling, and a bluish discoloration (cyanosis) of the skin (around the finger nails and lips), treat as a complete airway obstruction.Complete Airway ObstructionA complete airway obstruction presents with a completely blocked airway, and an inability to speak, cough, or breathe. If the casualty is conscious, he or she may display the universal distress signal. Ask \"Are YOU choking?\" If the casualty is choking, do the following:1.Shout \"Help\"-Ask the casualty if you can help.2.Request medical assistance- Say \"Airway is obstructed\" (blocked), call (Local emergency number or medical personnel).3.Abdominal thrusts(Heimlich Maneuver)a. Stand behind the casualty.b. Place your arms around the (Fig. 2-2) casualties waist.c. With your fist, place the thumb side against the middle of the abdomen, above the navel and below thetip (xiphoid process) of the (sternum) breastbone.d. Grasp your fist with your other hand.e. Keeping your elbows out, press your fist (Fig. 2-3) into the abdomen with a quick upward thrust.f. Repeat until the obstruction is clear or the casualty becomes unconscious.If the casualty becomes unconscious, do the following:Abdominal Thrustfollowed byHead Tilt-Chin Lift4.Finger sweep- Place the casualty on his or her back, open casualty's mouth and grasp the tongue and lower jaw between your thumb and fingers, lift jaw with your index finger into the mouth along inside of cheek to base of tongue. Use \"hooking\" motion to dislodge object for removal.5.Open airway(Head-tilt/Chin-lift) -Place your hand on the casualty's forehead. Place the fingers of your other hand under the (Fig. 2-4) bony part of the chin. Avoid putting pressure under the chin, it may cause an obstruction of the airway. Tilt the head and lift the jaw, avoid closing the casualty's mouth. Place your ear over the casualty's mouth and nose. Look at the chest, listen and feel for breathing, 3 to 5 seconds. If not breathing, say, \"Not Breathing.\" (jaw-thrust maneuver) - If you suspect the casualty may have an injury to the head, neck, or back, you must minimize movement of the casualty when opening the airway. Kneeling at the top of the casualty's head, place your elbows on the surface. Place your fingers behind the angle of the jaw or hook your fingers under the jaw, bring jaw forward. Separate the lips with your thumbs to allow breathing through the mouth. Note that the head is not tilted and the neck is not extended.6.Give breaths- Pinch nose, open your mouth, take a deep breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth. Give 2 full breaths, each lasting 1 to 1-1/2seconds. Pause between each breath. If unsuccessful, perform abdominal thrusts.7.Perform abdominal thrustsa. Straddle the casualty's thighs.b. Place the heel of your hand against the middle of the abdomen, above the navel and below the tip ofthe breastbone.c. Place your other hand directly on top of the first (Fingers should point towards the casualty's head).d. Press abdomen 6 to 10 times with quick upward thrusts.8.Continue steps 4 to 7-Until successful, you are exhausted, you are relieved by another trained individual, or by medical personnel.If the casualty is found unconscious, do the following:1.Check unresponsiveness- Tap or gently shake the casualty, shout, \"Are you OK?\"2.Shout, \"Help\"- If there is no response from casualty.3.Position casualty- Kneel midway between his or her hips and shoulders facing casualty. Straighten legs, and move arm closest to you above casualty's head. Place your hand on the casualty's shoulder and one on the hip. Roll casualty toward you as a unit, move your hand from the shoulder to support the back of the head and neck. Place the casualty's arm nearest you alongside his or her body.4.Open airway(Head-tilt/Chin-lift or Jaw-thrust) - Place your hand on the casualty's forehead. Place the fingers of your other hand under the bony part of the chin. Avoid putting pressure under the chin, it may cause an obstruction of the airway. Tilt the head and lift the jaw, avoid closing casualty's mouth. Place your ear over the casualty's mouth and nose. Look at the chest, listen, and feel for breathing, 3 to 5 seconds. If not breathing, say, \"Not Breathing.\"5.Give breaths- Pinch nose, open your mouth, take a deep breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth. Give 2 full breaths, each lasting 1 to 1-1/2seconds. Pause between each breath. If unsuccessful, reposition head, and give 2 full breaths.6.Request medical assistance- Say \"Airway is obstructed\" (blocked), call local emergency number or medical personnel.7.Perform abdominal thrustsa. Straddle the casualty's thighs.b. Place the heel of your hand against the middle of the abdomen, above the navel and below the tip ofthe breastbone.c. Place your other hand directly on top of the first (fingers should point towards the casualty's head).d. Press abdomen 6 to 10 times with quick upward thrusts.8.Finger sweep- Place the casualty on his or her back, open the casualty's mouth and grasp the tongue and lower jaw between your thumb and fingers, lift jaw, insert your index finger into the mouth along the inside of cheek to base of tongue. Use \"hooking\" motion to dislodge object for removal.9.Give breaths- Pinch nose, open your mouth, take a deep breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth. Give 2 full breaths, each lasting 1 to 1 1/2 seconds. Pause between each breath.10.Continue steps 7 to 9- Until successful, you are exhausted, you are relieved by another trained individual, or by medical personnel.Chest ThrustsThe chest thrust is the preferred method, in place of the abdominal thrust, for individuals who are overweight or pregnant. Manual pressure to the abdominal area in these individuals can be ineffective or cause serious damage. If the casualty is overweight or pregnant, do the following:1.Conscious- Standing or Sitting.a. Stand behind the casualty.b. Place your arms under the casualty's armpits and around the chest.c. With your fist, place the thumb side against the middle of the breastbone.d. Grasp your fist with your other hand.e. Press your fist against the chest with a sharp, backward thrust until the obstruction is clear or casualtybecomes unconscious.2.Unconscious- Lying.a. Kneel, facing the casualty's chest.b. With the middle and index fingers of the hand nearest the casualty's legs, locate the lower edge of the ribcage on the side closest to you.c. Slide your fingers up the rib cage to the notch at td. Place your middle finger on the notch, and your index finger next to it.e. Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone next to the index finger.f. Place the heel of your hand, used to locate the notch, on top of the heel of your other hand.g. Keep your fingers off the casualty's chest.h. Position your shoulders over your hands, with elbows locked and arms straight.i. Give 6 to 10 quick and distinct downward thrusts, each should compress the chest 1 1/2 to 2 inches.j. Finger sweep.k. Open the airway and give 2 full breaths.Repeat the last three steps until the obstruction is clear, you are exhausted, you are relieved by another trained individual, or by medical personnel.Self Abdominal ThrustsIf you are alone and choking, try not to panic, you can perform an abdominal thrust on yourself by doing the following:1. With the fist of your hand, place the thumb side against the middle of your abdomen, above the navel and below the tip of the breastbone. Grasp your fist with your other hand and give a quick upward thrust.2. You also can lean forward and press your abdomen over the back of a chair (with rounded edge), a railing, or a sink.If the casualty is not breathing, do the following:Rescue BreathingRescue breathing is the process of breathing air into the lungs of a casualty who has stopped breathing (respiratory arrest), also known as artificial respiration. The common causes are air-way obstruction, drowning, electric shock, drug overdose, and chest or lung (trauma) injury.Never give rescue breathing to a person who is breathing normally.1.Check unresponsiveness- Tap or gently shake the casualty, shout, \"Are you OK?\"2.Shout, \"Help\"- If there is no response from casualty.3.Position casualty- Kneel midway between his or her hips and shoulders facing the casualty. Straighten legs and move arm closest to you above casualty's head. Place your hand on the casualty's shoulder and one on the hip. Roll casualty toward you as a unit, move your hand from the shoulder to support the back of the head and neck. Place the casualty's arm nearest you alongside his/her body.4.Open airway(Head-tilt/Chin lift or Jaw thrust) - Place your hand on the casualty's forehead. Place the fingers of your other hand under the bony part of the chin. Avoid putting pressure under the chin, it may cause an obstruction of the airway. Tilt the head and lift the jaw, avoid closing the casualty's mouth. Place your ear over the casualty's mouth and nose. Look at the chest, listen, and feel for breathing, 3 to 5 seconds. If not breathing, say, \"Not breathing.\"5.Give breaths- Pinch nose, open your mouth, take a deep breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth. Give 2 full breaths, each lasting 1 to 1 1/2 seconds. Pause between each breath. Look for the chest to rise, listen, and feel for breathing.6.Check pulse- While maintaining an open airway, locate the Adam's apple with your middle and index fingers. Slide your fingers down into the groove, on the side closest to you. Feel for a carotid pulse for 5 to 10 seconds. If you feel a pulse, say, \"No breathing, but there is a pulse.\" Quickly examine the casualty for signs of bleeding.7.Request medical assistance- Say \"No breathing, has a pulse,\" call (Local emergency number or medical personnel).8.Rescue breathing(mouth-to-mouth) Maintain an open airway with head-tilt/chin-lift or jaw-thrust maneuver, pinch nose. Open your mouth, take a deep breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth. Give 1 breath every 5 seconds, each lasting 1 to 1-1/2seconds. Count aloud \"one one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand, four one-thousand,\" take a breath, and then give a breath. Look at the chest, listen, and feel for breathing. Continue for 1 minute/12 breaths.9.Recheck pulse- While maintaining an open airway, locate and feel the carotid pulse for 5 seconds. If you feel a pulse, say, \"Has pulse.\" Look at the chest, listen, and feel for breathing 3 to 5 seconds. If the casualty is not breathing, say, \"No breathing.\"10.Continue sequence- Maintain an open airway, give 1 breath every 5 seconds, recheck pulse every minute. If pulse is absent, begin CPR. If pulse is present but breathing is absent, continue rescue breathing. If the casualty begins to breathe, maintain an open airway, until medical assistance arrives.Special Situations1.Air in the stomach(Gastric Distention) - During rescue breathing and CPR, air may enter the stomach in addition to the lungs. To avoid this, keep the casualty's head tilted back, breathe only enough to make the chest rise, and do not give breaths too fast.Do not attempt to expel stomach contents by pressing on the abdomen.2.Mouth-to-nose breathing- Used when the casualty has mouth or jaw injuries, is bleeding from the mouth, or your mouth is too small to make an air-tight seal. Maintain head tilt with your hand on the forehead, use your other hand to seal the casualty's mouth and lift the chin. Take a deep breath and seal your mouth around the casualty's nose and slowly breathe into the casualty's nose using the procedures for mouth-to-mouth breathing.3.Mouth-to-stoma breathing- Used when the casualty has had surgery to remove part of the windpipe. They breathe through an opening in the front of the neck, called a stoma. Cover the casualty's mouth with your hand, take a deep breath, and seal your mouth over the stoma and slowly breathe using the procedures for mouth-to-mouth breathing.Do not tilt the head back.(In some situations a person may breathe through the stoma as well as his or her nose and mouth. If the casualty's chest does not rise, you should cover his or her mouth and nose and continue breathing through the stoma).4.Mouth-to-mask breathing- Used when rescue breathing is required in a contaminated environment, such as after a chemical or biological attack. A resuscitation tube is used to deliver uncontaminated air to the casualty. This resuscitation tube has an adapter at one end that attaches to your mask and a molded rubber mouthpiece at the other end for the mouth of the casualty.5.Dentures- Leave dentures in place, they provide support to the mouth and cheeks during rescue breathing. If they become loose and block the airway or make it difficult to give breaths, remove them.CirculationCirculation is the movement of blood through the heart and blood vessels. The circulatory system consists of the heart, which pumps the blood, and the blood vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body.Cardiac arrest is the failure of the heart to produce a useful blood flow or the heart has completely stopped beating. The signs of cardiac arrest include unconsciousness, the absence of a pulse, and the absence of breathing. If the casualty is to survive, immediate action must be taken to restore breathing and circulation.Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure for the casualty who is not breathing and whose heart has stopped beating (cardiac arrest). The procedure involves a combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing. The casualty must be lying face up on a firm surface. Do not assume that a cardiac arrest has occurred simply because the casualty appears to be unconscious.This course is not a substitute for formal training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).Chest Compressionsa. Kneel, facing the casualty's chest.b. With your middle and index fingers (Fig. 2-11) of the hand nearest the casualty's legs, locate the lower edge of the rib cage on the side closest to you.c. Slide your fingers up the rib cage to the notch at the end of the breastbone.d. Place your middle finger on the notch, and your index finger next to it.e. Place the heel of your other hand on the breastbone next to your index finger.f. Place the heel of the hand used to locate the notch on top of the heel of your other hand.g. Keep your fingers off the casualty's chest.h. Position shoulders over your hands, with elbows locked and arms straight.i. Give 15 compressions, each should compress the chest 1 1/2 to 2 inches at a rate of 80 to 100 compressions per minute. Count aloud, \"One and two and three,\" until you reach 15. After each 15 compressions, deliver 2 full breaths. Compressions should be smooth, rhythmic, and uninterrupted.j. Continue 4 complete cycles of 15 compressions and 2 breaths. Check for a carotid pulse and breathing for 5 seconds.Continue CPR- If the casualty has no pulse, give 2 full breaths and continue CPR. Check for a pulse every few minutes. If the pulse is present but breathing is absent, continue rescue breathing. If the casualty begins to breathe, maintain an open airway until medical assistance arrives. Continue CPR until successful, you are exhausted, you are relieved by another trained in CPR, by medical personnel, or the casualty is pronounced dead.Do not interrupt CPR for more than 7 seconds except for special circumstances.CPR with Entry of Second PersonWhen a second person who is trained in administering CPR arrives at the scene, do the following:1. The second person shall identify himself or herself as being trained in CPR and that they are willing to help. (\"I know CPR. Can I help?\")2. The second person should call the local emergency number or medical personnel for assistance if it has not already been done.3. The person doing CPR will indicate when he or she is tired; and should stop CPR after the next 2 full breaths.4. The second person should kneel next to the casualty opposite the first person, tilt the casualty's head back, and check for a carotid pulse for 5 seconds.5. If there is no pulse, the second rescuer should give 2 full breaths and continue CPR.6. The first person will monitor the effectiveness of CPR by looking for the chest to rise during rescue breathing and feeling for a carotid pulse (artificial pulse) during chest compressions.CPR for Children and InfantsIf the casualty is an infant (0-1 year old) or child (1-8 years old), do the following:1.Check unresponsiveness- Infant: Tap or shake shoulder only. Child: Tap or gently shake the shoulder, shout, \"Are you OK?\"2.Shout, \"Help\"- If there is no response from infant or child.3.Position casualty- Turn casualty on back as a unit, supporting, the head and neck. Place casualty on a firm surface.4.Open airway(Head-tilt/Chin-lift or jaw thrust) - Place your hand on the casualty's forehead. Place the fingers of your other hand under the bony part of the chin. Avoid putting pressure under the chin, it may cause an obstruction of the airway. Tilt the head and lift the jaw, avoid closing the casualty's mouth. Infant: Do not overextend the head and neck. Place your ear over the casualty's mouth and nose. Look at the chest, listen, and feel for breathing, 3 to 5 seconds.5.Give breaths- Open your mouth, take a breath, and make an air-tight seal around the casualty's mouth and nose. Give 2 breaths (puffs for infants), each lasting 1 to 1 1/2 seconds. Pause between each breath. Look for the chest to rise, listen, and feel for breathing.6.Check pulse- While maintaining an open airway, locate the carotid pulse (Infants: Locate the brachial pulse on the inside of the upper arm, between the elbow and shoulder). Feel for a pulse for 5 to 10 seconds. Quickly examine the casualty for signs of bleeding.7.Request medical assistance- If someone responded to your call for help, send them to call the local emergency number or medical personnel.8.Chest compressions (infant)-a. Face infant's chest.b. Place your middle and index fingers on the breastbone at the nipple line.c. Give 5 compressions, each should compress the chest 1/2 to 1 inch at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. After each 5th compression, deliver 1 breath. Compressions should be smooth, rhythmic, and uninterrupted.d. Continue for 10 complete cycles of 5 compressions and 1 breath. Check for a brachial pulse for 5 seconds.9.Chest compressions (children)-a. Face child's chest.b. With your middle and index fingers of the hand nearest the child's legs, locate the lower edge of the rib cage on the side closest to you.c. Slide your fingers up the rib cage to the notch at end of the breastbone.d. Place your middle finger on the notch, and your index finger next to it.e. While looking at the position of your index finger, lift that hand and place your heel (on breastbone at nipple line) next to where your index finger was.f. Keep your fingers off the child's chest.g. Position your shoulder over your hand, with elbow locked and your arm straight.h. Give 5 compressions, each should compress the chest 1 to 1 1/2 inches at a rate of 80 to 100 compressions per minute. After each 5th compression, deliver 1 breath. Compressions should be smooth, rhythmic, and uninterrupted.i. Continue for 10 complete cycles of 3 compressions and 1 breath. Check for a carotid pulse for 5 seconds.10.Continue CPR- If the infant or child has no pulse, give 1 breath and continue CPR. Check for a pulse every few minutes. If the pulse is present but breathing is absent, continue rescue breathing (Infant: 20 breaths/min; Child: 15 breaths/min.) If the infant or child begins to breathe, maintain an open airway, until medical assistance arrives. Continue CPR until successful, you are exhausted, you are relieved by another trained in CPR or medical personnel, or the infant or child is pronounced dead.This course is not a substitute for formal training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).",
  "Bleeding": "Bleeding (hemorrhage) is the escape of blood from capillaries, veins, and arteries.Capillariesare very small blood vessels that carry blood to all parts of the body.Veinsare blood vessels that carry blood to the heart.Arteriesare large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Bleeding can occur inside the body (internal), outside the body (external) or both. Blood is a fluid that consists of a pale yellow liquid (plasma), red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Plasma is the fluid portion of the blood that carries nutrients. Red blood cells give color to the blood and carry oxygen. White blood cells defend the body against infection and attack foreign particles. Platelets are disk shaped and assist in clotting the blood, the mechanism that stops bleeding. There are three types of bleeding. Capillary bleeding is slow, the blood \"oozes\" from the (wound) cut. Venous bleeding is dark red or maroon, the blood flows in a steady stream. Arterial bleeding is bright red, the blood \"spurts\" from the wound.Arterial bleeding is life threatening and difficult to control.In small wounds, only the capillaries are damaged. Deeper wounds result in damage to the veins and arteries. Damage to the capillaries is usually not serious and can easily be controlled with a Band-Aid. Damage to the veins and arteries are more serious and can be life threatening. The adult body contains approximately 5 to 6 quarts of blood (10 to 12 pints). The body can normally lose 1 pint of blood (usual amount given by donors) without harmful effects. A loss of 2 pints may cause shock, a loss of 5 to 6 pints usually results in death. During certain situations it will be difficult to decide whether the bleeding is arterial or venous. The distinction is not important. The most important thing to remember is that all bleeding must be controlled as soon as possible.External BleedingWhile administering first aid to a casualty who is bleeding, you must remain calm. The sight of blood is an emotional event for many, and it often appears severe. However, most bleeding is less severe than it appears. Most of the major arteries are deep and well protected by tissue and bone. Although bleeding can be fatal, you will usually have enough time to think and act calmly. There are four methods to control bleeding: direct pressure, elevation, indirect pressure, and the use of a tourniquet.Direct PressureDirect pressure is the first and most effective method to control bleeding. In many cases, bleeding can be controlled by applying pressure directly (Fig. 3-1) to the wound. Place a sterile dressing or clean cloth on the wound, tie a knot or adhere tape directly over the wound, only tight enough to control bleeding. If bleeding is not controlled, apply another dressing over the first or apply direct pressure with your hand or fingers over the wound. Direct pressure can be applied by the casualty or a bystander.Under no circumstances is a dressing removed once it has been applied.ElevationRaising (elevation) of an injured arm or leg (extremity) above the level of the heart will help control bleeding. Elevation should be used together with direct pressure. Do not elevate an extremity if you suspect a broken bone (fracture) until it has been properly splinted and you are certain that elevation will not cause further injury. Use a stable object to maintain elevation. Placing an extremity on an unstable object may cause further injury.Indirect PressureIn cases of severe bleeding when direct pressure and elevation are not controlling the bleeding, indirect pressure must be used. Bleeding from an artery can be controlled by applying pressure to the appropriate pressure point. Pressure points (Fig. 3-2) are areas of the body where the blood flow can be controlled by pressing the artery against an underlying bone. Pressure is applied with the fingers, thumb, or heel of the hand.Pressure points should be used with caution. Indirect pressure can cause damage to the extremity due to inadequate blood flow. Do not apply pressure to the neck (carotid) pressure points, it can cause cardiac arrest.Indirect pressure is used in addition to direct pressure and elevation. Pressure points in the arm (brachial) and in the groin (femoral) are most often used, and should be thoroughly understood. The brachial artery is used to control severe bleeding of the lower part of the upper arm and elbow. It is located above the elbow on the inside of the arm in the groove between the muscles. Using your fingers or thumb, apply pressure (Fig. 3-2E) to the inside of the arm over the bone. The femoral artery is used to control severe bleeding of the thigh and lower leg. It is located on the front, center part of the crease in the groin. Position the casualty on his or her back, kneel on the opposite side (Fig. 3-2H ) from the wounded leg, place the heel of your hand directly on the pressure point, and lean forward to apply pressure. If the bleeding is not controlled, it may be necessary to press directly over the artery with the flat surface of the fingertips and to apply additional pressure on the fingertips with the heel of your other hand.TourniquetA tourniquet should beused only as a last resortto control severe bleeding after all other methods have failed and isused only on the extremities. Before use, you must thoroughly understand its dangers and limitations. Tourniquets cause tissue damage and loss of extremities when used by untrained individuals. Tourniquets are rarely required and should only be used when an arm or leg has been partially or completely severed and when bleeding is uncontrollable.The standard tourniquet is normally a piece of cloth folded until it is 3 or more inches wide and 6 or 7 layers thick. A tourniquet can be a strap, belt, neckerchief, towel, or other similar item. A folded triangular bandage makes a great tourniquet.Never use wire, cord, or any material that will cut the skin.To apply a tourniquet, do the following:1. While maintaining the proper pressure point, place the tourniquet between the heart and the wound, leaving at least 2 inches of uninjured skin between the tourniquet and wound.2. Place a pad (roll) over the artery.3. Wrap the tourniquet around the extremity twice, and tie a half-knot on the upper surface.4. Place a short stick or similar object on the half-knot, and tie a square knot.5. Twist the stick to tighten, until bleeding is controlled.6. Secure the stick in place.7.Never cover a tourniquet.8. Using lipstick or marker, make a 'T\" on the casualty's forehead and the time tourniquet was applied.9.Never loosen or remove a tourniquetonce it has been applied. The loosening of a tourniquet may dislodge clots and result in enough blood loss to cause shock and death.Do not touch open wounds with your fingers unless absolutely necessary. Place a barrier between you and the casualty's blood or body fluids, using plastic wrap, gloves, or a clean, folded cloth. Wash your hands with soap and warm water immediately after providing care, even if you wore gloves or used another barrier.Internal BleedingInternal bleeding, although not usually visible, can result in serious blood loss. A casualty with internal bleeding can develop shock before you realize the extent of their injuries. Bleeding from the mouth, ears, nose, rectum, or other body opening (orifice) is considered serious and normally indicates internal bleeding.The most common sign of internal bleeding is a simple bruise (contusion), it indicates bleeding into the skin (soft tissues). Severe internal bleeding occurs in injuries caused by a violent force (automobile accident), puncture wounds (knife), and broken bones.Signs of internal bleeding include:1. Anxiety and restlessness.2. Excessive thirst (polydipsia).3. Nausea and vomiting.4. Cool, moist, and pale skin (cold and clammy).5. Rapid breathing (tachypnea).6. Rapid, weak pulse (tachycardia).7. Bruising or discoloration at site of injury (contusion).If you suspect internal bleeding, do the following:1. Bruise (contusion) - Apply ice or cold pack, with cloth to prevent damage to the skin, to reduce pain and (edema) swelling.2. Severe internal bleeding:a. Call local emergency number or medical personnel.b. Monitor airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).c. Treat for shock.d. Place casualty in most comfortable position.e. Maintain normal body temperature.f. Reassure casualtyNosebleedNosebleeds (epistaxis) can be caused by an injury, disease, the environment, high blood pressure, and changes in altitude. They frighten the casualty and may bleed enough to cause shock.If a fractured skull is suspected as the cause, do not stop the bleeding. Cover the nose with a loose, dry, sterile dressing and call the local emergency number or medical personnel. If the casualty has a nosebleed due to other causes, do the following:1. Keep the casualty quiet, sitting with head tilted forward.2. Pinch the nose shut (if there is no fracture), place ice or cold packs to the bridge of the nose, or put pressure on the upper lip just below the nose. Inform the casualty not to rub, blow, or pick his or her nose. Seek medical assistance if the nosebleed continues, bleeding starts again, or bleeding is because of high blood pressure.If the casualty loses consciousness, place them on their side to allow blood to drain from the nose and call the local emergency number or medical personnel.Foreign bodies in the nose usually occur among children. First aid consists of seeking professional medical attention. Nasal damage and the possibility of pushing the object farther up the nose can result from searching and attempts at removal by unqualified personnel.Casualties with severe external bleeding and suspected internal bleeding must be seen by medical personnel as soon as possible. All casualties with external and internal bleeding should be treated for shock.",
  "Shock": "Shock, is the failure of the heart and blood vessels (circulatory system) to maintain enough oxygen-rich blood flowing (perfusion) to the vital organs of the body. There is shock to some degree with every illness or injury; shock can be life threatening. The principles of prevention and control are to recognize the signs and symptoms and to begin treating the casualty before shock completely develops. It is unlikely that you will see all the signs and symptoms of shock in a single casualty. Sometimes the signs and symptoms may be disguised by the illness or injury or they may not appear immediately. In fact many times, they appear hours later.The usual signs and symptoms of the development of shock are:1. Anxiety, restlessness and fainting.2. Nausea and vomiting.3. Excessive thirst (polydipsia).4. Eyes are vacant, dull (lackluster), large (dilated) pupils.5. Shallow, rapid (tachypnea), and irregular breathing.6. Pale, cold, moist (clammy) skin.7. Weak, rapid (tachycardia), or absent pulse.Hypovolemic ShockHypovolemic shock is caused by a decreased amount of blood or fluids in the body. This decrease results from injuries that produce internal and external bleeding, fluid loss due to burns, and dehydration due to severe vomiting and diarrhea.Neurogenic ShockNeurogenic shock is caused by an abnormal enlargement of the (vasodilation) blood vessels and pooling of the blood to a degree that adequate blood flow cannot be maintained. Simple fainting (syncope) is a variation, it is the result of a temporary pooling of the blood as a person stands. As the person falls, blood rushes back to the head and the problem is solved.Psychogenic ShockPsychogenic shock is a \"shock like condition\" produced by excessive fear, joy, anger, or grief. Shell shock is a psychological adjustment reaction to stressful wartime experiences. Care for shell shock is limited to emotional support and transportation of the casualty to a medical facility.Anaphylactic ShockAnaphylactic (allergic) shock occurs when an individual is exposed to a substance to which his or her body is sensitive. The individual may experience a burning sensation, loss of voice, itching (pruritus), hives, severe swelling, and difficulty breathing. The causative agents are injection of medicines, venoms by stinging insects and animals, inhalation of dust and pollens, and ingestion of certain foods and medications. Individuals with known sensitivities carry medication in commercially prepared kits.Prevention and Treatment of ShockWhile administering first aid to prevent or treat shock, you must remain calm. If shock has not completely developed, the first aid you provide may actually prevent its occurrence. If it has developed, you may be able to keep it from becoming fatal. It is extremely important that you render first aid immediately.To provide first aid for shock, do the following:1.Maintain open airway- Head-tilt/chin-lift or jaw-thrust.2.Control bleeding- Direct pressure, elevation, indirect pressure, or tourniquet if indicated.3.Position casualty- Place the casualty on his or her back, with legs elevated 6 to 12 inches. If it is possible, take advantage of a natural slope of ground and place the casualty so that the head is lower than the feet. If they are vomiting or bleeding around the mouth, place them on their side, or back with head turned to the side.If you suspect head or neck injuries, or are unsure of the casualty's condition, keep them lying flat.4.Splint- Suspected broken and dislocated bones in the position in which they are found.Do not attempt to straighten broken or dislocated bones, because of the high risk of causing further injury. Splinting not only relieves the pain without the use of drugs but prevents further tissue damage and shock. Pain and discomfort are often eliminated by unlacing or cutting a shoe or loosening tight clothing at the site of the injury. A simple adjustment of a bandage or splint will be of benefit, especially when accompanied by encouraging words.5. Keep the casualty comfortable, and warm enough to maintain normal body temperature. If possible, remove wet clothing and place blankets underneath the casualty.Never use an artificial means of warming.6. Keep the casualty as calm as possible. Excitement and excessive handling will aggravate their condition. Prevent the casualty from seeing his or her injuries, reassure them that their injuries are understood and that professional medical assistance will arrive as soon as possible.7.Give nothing by mouth- Do not give the casualty anything to eat or drink because it may cause vomiting. If the casualty complains of thirst, wet his or her lips with a wet towel.8.Request medical assistance- Ask bystanders to call the local emergency number or medical personnel.",
  "Soft Tissue Injuries": "The most common injuries (trauma) seen in a first aid setting are soft tissue injuries with bleeding and shock. Injuries that cause a break in the skin, underlying soft tissue, or other body membrane are known as a wound. Injuries to the soft tissues vary from bruises (contusion) to serious cuts (lacerations) and puncture wounds in which the object may remain in the wound (impaled objects). The two main threats with these injuries are bleeding and infection.Classification of WoundsWounds are classified according to their general condition, size, location, the manner in which the skin or tissue is broken, and the agent that caused the wound. It is usually necessary for you to consider some or all of these factors in order to determine what first aid treatment is appropriate.General ConditionIf the wound is new, first aid consists mainly of controlling the bleeding, treating for shock, and reducing the risk of infection. If the wound is old and infected, first aid consists of keeping the casualty quiet, elevating the injured part, and applying a warm wet dressing. If the wound contains foreign objects, first aid may consist of removing the objects if they are not deep.Do not remove impaled objects or objects embedded in the eyes or skull.SizeGenerally, large wounds are more serious than small ones and they usually involve severe bleeding, more damage to the underlying tissues and organs, and a greater degree of shock. However, small wounds are sometimes more dangerous than large ones: they may become infected more readily due to neglect. The depth of a wound also is important because it may lead to a complete (through & through) perforation of an organ or the body, with the additional complication of an entrance and exit wound.LocationSince a wound can cause serious damage to deep structures, as well as to the skin and tissues below it, the location is an important consideration. A knife wound to the chest is likely to puncture a lung and cause difficulty breathing. The same type of wound in the abdomen can cause a life-threatening infection, internal bleeding, or puncture the intestines, liver, or other vital organs. A bullet wound to the head may cause brain damage, but a bullet wound to the arm or leg, may cause no serious damage.Types of WoundsAs the first line of defense against most injuries, soft tissues are most often damaged. There are two types of soft tissue injuries: open and closed. An open wound is one in which the skin surface has been broken, a closed wound is where the skin surface is unbroken but underlying tissues have been damaged.Closed WoundsA blunt object that strikes the body will damage tissues beneath the skin. When the damage is minor, the wound is called a bruise (contusion). When the tissue has extensive damage, blood and fluid collect under the skin causing discoloration (ecchymosis), swelling (edema), and pain. First aid consists of applying ice or cold packs to reduce swelling and relieve discomfort.To guard against frostbite, never apply ice or cold packs directly to the skin.Hematomasare the result of a severe blunt injury with extensive soft tissue damage, tearing of large blood vessels, and pooling of large amounts of blood below the skin. With large hematomas, look for broken bones, especially if deformity is present. First aid consists of applying ice or cold packs to reduce swelling and relieve pain, direct pressure (manual compression) to help control internal bleeding, splinting, and elevation. When large areas of bruising are present, shock may develop.Open WoundsIn open soft tissue injuries, the protective layer of the skin has been damaged. This damage can cause serious internal and external bleeding. Once the protective layer of skin has been broken, the wound becomes contaminated and may become infected. When you consider the way in which the skin or tissue has been broken, there are six basic types of open wounds: abrasions, amputations, avulsions, incisions, lacerations, and punctures. Many wounds are a combination of two or more of these types.AbrasionsAbrasions are caused when the skin is rubbed or scraped off. Rope burns, floor burns, and skinned knees or elbows are common examples of abrasions. Abrasions easily can become infected, because dirt and germs are usually ground into the tissues. There is normally minimal bleeding or oozing of clear fluid.AmputationsAmputations (traumatic) are the non-surgical removal of the fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, and ears from the body. Bleeding is heavy and normally requires a tourniquet, to control the blood flow. There are three types of amputation:1. Complete - Body part is completely torn off (severed).2. Partial - More than 50% of the body part is torn off.3. De-gloving - Skin and tissue are torn away from body part.If the casualty has an amputation, do the following:1.Establish and maintainthe airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).2.Control bleedingwith direct pressure, elevation, indirect pressure, or tourniquetonly as a last resort, never remove or loosen a tourniquet once it has been applied.3.Apply dressingto the stump with an ace wrap to replace direct pressure.4.Treat for shock.5.Request medical assistance immediately.AvulsionsAn avulsion is an injury in which the skin is torn completely away from a body part or is left hanging as a flap. Usually, there is severe bleeding. If possible, obtain the part that has been torn away, rinse it in water, wrap it in a dry sterile gauze, seal it in a plastic bag, and send it on ice with the casualty.Do not allow part to freeze and do not submerge in water. If the skin is still attached, fold the flap back into its normal position.IncisionsIncisions, commonly called cuts, are wounds made by sharp cutting instruments such as knives, razors, or broken glass. Incisions tend to bleed freely because the blood vessels are cut cleanly, without ragged edges. The wound edges are smooth and there is little damage to the surrounding tissues. Of all the classes of open wounds, incisions are the least likely to become infected.LacerationsLacerations are wounds that are torn, rather than cut. They have ragged, irregular edges and torn tissue underneath. These wounds are usually made by a blunt, rather than a sharp, object. A wound made by a dull knife is more likely to be a laceration than an incision. Many of the wounds caused by machinery accidents are lacerations, often complicated by crushed tissues. Lacerations are frequently contaminated with dirt, grease, or other materials that are ground into the wound; they are very likely to become infected.PuncturesPunctures are caused by objects that enter the skin while leaving a surface opening. Wounds made by nails, needles, wire, knives, and bullets are normally punctures. Small puncture wounds usually do not bleed freely; however, large puncture wounds may cause severe internal bleeding. The possibility of infection is great in all puncture wounds, especially if the penetrating object is contaminated. Perforation (through & through) is a variation, it is the result of a penetrating object entering, passing through, and exiting the body.CausesAlthough it is not necessary to know what object or method has caused a wound, it is helpful. Knowing what caused the wound and how it occurred can help you determine its general condition, possible size, type, and seriousness of the wound. This information will help you provide the appropriate first aid to the casualty.Treatment of WoundsFirst aid treatment for all wounds consists of controlling the flow of blood, treating for shock, and preventing infection. When providing first aid to casualty with multiple injuries, treat the wounds that appear to be life-threatening first. Since most of the body is covered by clothing, carefully examine the entire body for bleeding. When necessary, tear or cut clothing away from the wound because excessive movement of the injured part will cause pain and additional damage.BleedingAfter establishing an adequate open airway, the main concern will be to control bleeding, by direct pressure and elevation. Indirect pressure and the use of a tourniquet should be used only if direct pressure and elevation do not control the bleeding. A protective covering (dressing) that is properly applied should adequately control the bleeding. In cases of severe bleeding, you may need to double the dressing. Never remove a dressing that is soaked with blood to replace it with another; just place the new dressing over the old one.InfectionInfections can occur in any wound. Infection is a hazard in wounds that do not bleed freely; in wounds where tissue is torn or the skin falls back into place and prevents the entrance of air; and in wounds that involve the crushing of tissue. Incisions, in which there is a free flow of blood and relatively little crushing of tissues, are the least likely to become infected. The signs of infection are tenderness, redness, heat, swelling, and a discharge. Serious infections develop red streaks that lead from the wound to the heart. Infections are dangerous, especially in the area of the nose and mouth. From this area infections spread easily into the bloodstream, causing blood poisoning (septicemia), and into the brain, causing a collection of pus (abscess) and infection. Small wounds should be washed immediately with soap and water, dried, and treated with an application of a mild, non-irritating antiseptic. Apply a dressing if necessary. Make no attempt to wash a large wound and do not apply an antiseptic. Cover the wound with a dry, sterile dressing. Further treatment of large wounds should be conducted by medical personnel.All puncture wounds must be evaluated by medical personnel.Foreign BodiesMany wounds contain foreign bodies. Wood or glass splinters, bullets, metal fragments, wire, fishhooks, nails, and small particles from grinding wheels are examples of materials that are found in wounds. In most cases, first aid will include the removal of this material if the wound is minor and the object is near the surface and exposed. However, first aid does not include the removal of deeply embedded objects, powdered glass, or any scattered material.Never attempt to remove bullets, examine the casualty to find out whether the bullet remains in the body by looking for both an entrance and exit wound. \u00a0The general rule is: Remove foreign objects from a wound ONLY when you can do so easily and without causing further damage.Do not attempt to remove an object that is embedded in the eye or that has penetrated the eye.Treatment of Specific ConditionsIt is impossible to list all wounds in simple categories. Some require special treatment and precautions. You may see wounds that are not described in this course, but most wounds can be treated by calmly remembering the general treatment of wounds.Eye WoundsForeign bodies such as particles of dirt, sand, paint chips, or fine pieces of metal frequently find their way into the eyes. They not only cause discomfort, but if not removed, they can cause inflammation and infection. Fortunately, through an increased flow of tears, nature dislodges many of these particles before any damage is done.Never let the casualty rub the eye, since rubbing, can cause scratches (abrasions) to the eye and can push a foreign body deeper into the eye, causing further damage.Gently flush the casualty's eye with water at least 15 to 20 minutes. If flushing the eye is not successful in removing the foreign body, patch both eyes and get the casualty to medical personnel. It is always safer to send the casualty to medical personnel than for you to attempt to remove foreign bodies. If the casualty has an object embedded in, or penetrating from, the eye, or the eyeball is protruding from the socket, do the following:1 .Take a thick dressing or several dressings and cut a hole in the middle, large enough to go over the eye without touching the object. If you cannot cut a hole in the dressing, you can build several dressings around the object.2. Take a paper cup or other object that is wide enough and strong enough to adequately protect the object without putting pressure on the eye. Place this over the top of the object. Close and cover the unaffected eye to minimize movement of the injured eye.3. Take a roller bandage and wrap it over the cup and around the head several times ensuring that the cup and dressing are snug enough not to come off, but not tight enough to cause discomfort.When finished, this type of dressing will adequately protect the eye.Laceration of the EyelidsSoft tissues around the eye bleed extensively. This bleeding may make the wound look more serious than it is. However, the bleeding can be controlled easily with a pressure dressing.Before any pressure is applied to the eye, make sure that the eyeball is not cut. If the eye is cut, do not apply pressure to the eye, even to stop bleeding from the eyelid. Pressing on the eye will cause the fluid to leak out, and will result in irreparable damage. If the eyelid is cut and you find fragments of skin, rinse them in water, wrap in a dry sterile gauze, seal in a plastic bag, and send it on ice with the casualty.Do not allow part to freeze and do not submerge in water. If the skin is still attached, fold the flap back into its normal position.When you cover the injured eye you must also cover the good eye. The eyes move together, and even when the injured eye is patched it will move when the good eye moves. Tell the casualty what you are doing, this will reduce their fears of not being able to see.Foreign Objects in the EarForeign bodies such as particles of dirt, paint chips, or small insects find their way into the ears. They not only cause discomfort but, if not removed, they can cause inflammation and infection.Never insert anything into the earto dislodge foreign bodies because you can damage the lining of the ear or cut (perforate) the ear drum. Do not attempt to flush objects out with water; many absorb water and can cause damage from swelling. In the case of insects, if it is alive, shining a light into the ear may attract the insect and cause it to come out. It is always safer to send the casualty to medical personnel than for you to attempt to remove foreign bodies.Head WoundsInjuries to the head (scalp) can occur as a result of diving, automobile accidents, falls, blunt trauma, knives, bullets, and many other causes. Head wounds can be open or closed. In open head wounds there is an obvious injury in which there is normally a lot of bleeding. Closed head wounds may not be obvious, many times you will have to treat the casualty based on how the accident happened. You may see only the delayed symptoms, such as a seizure, confusion, or personality changes. Head wounds must be treated with particular care, since there is always the possibility of brain damage.If you suspect the casualty has suffered a head injury, look for the following:1. Depressions, lacerations, deformities, bruising around the eyes (Raccoon's Sign) or behind the ears (Battle's Sign).2. Never touch a wound, examine a wound to determine depth, separate the edges of a wound, or remove impaled objects.3. Check the eyes: Are the pupils (constricted) small, (dilated) large, equal, or unequal?4. Blood or clear (cerebrospinal) fluid dripping from the nose or ears. (Cover loosely with a sterile dressing to absorb but not stop the flow).If you suspect a head injury, do the following:1.Positionthe casualty flat, stabilize the head and neck as you found them by placing your hands on both sides of the head.2.Establish and maintain open airwayusing the jaw-thrust maneuver. Note that the head is not tilted and the neck is not extended. Check the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's).3.Finger sweepto remove any foreign bodies from the mouth.4.Maintaina neutral position of the head and neck and, if possible, apply a cervical collar or improvised (towel) collar.5.Control bleedingusing gentle, continuous pressure.Never apply direct pressure if the skull is depressed or bone fragments are seen.6.Apply dressing- Do not use direct pressure or tie knots over the wound. Apply ice or cold packs with cloth to prevent damage to the skin.7.Treat for shock- Casualtyies with suspected head and neck injuries are to remain flat.Do not raise the casualty's feet. If casualty is vomiting or bleeding around the mouth, place them on their side keeping the neck straight.Do not give anything to eat or drink.8.Request medical assistance immediately- Time is critical.Facial WoundsFacial wounds are treated, generally, like other flesh wounds. However, ensure that the tongue or soft tissue does not cause an airway obstruction. Keep the nose and throat clear of all foreign material and position the casualty so that blood will drain out of the mouth and nose. Facial wounds and scalp wounds bleed freely. Any casualty that has suffered a facial wound that involves the eye, eyelids, or the tissues around the eye must receive professional medical attention as soon as possible. First aid for other facial wounds is the same as head wounds.Standard First Aid BoxesNon-medical personnel are an important element in providing first aid to casualties prior to the arrival of professional medical personnel. Many lives have been saved by the first aid rendered by a shipmate. Standard first aid boxes are distributed throughout a ship to provide easy access to first aid supplies. The number of first aid boxes and their location depends on the ship's mission and the size of her crew. Various dressings, wire splints, tape, Band-Aids, tourniquets, skin pencils, and other first aid supplies are included in these boxes. Each box is secured with a wire or plastic seal that can be easily broken. The seals are used to identify whether the kit has been opened. A broken seal indicates that the first aid box must be inventoried and restocked. The standard first aid box has three compartments. Each compartment should have a plastic bag that is complete with the basic first aid supplies. Take one of these bags with you on your way to the casualty. Failure to take a bag to the scene may result in you having to go back for supplies. The box does not contain needles, syringes, or medications; but does contain the proper supplies needed to render first aid until medical assistance arrives.First aid boxes are for emergency use only! Report all broken seals to medical personnel as soon as possible. It is important that you know the contents and locations of these boxes.DressingsA dressingis a protective covering for a wound and is used to control bleeding and prevent contamination of the wound.A compressis a sterile pad that is placed directly on the wound.A bandageis material used to hold a compress in place. When applying a dressing, ensure that it remains as sterile as possible. The part of the dressing that is placed against the wound mustnevertouch your fingers, clothing, or any un-sterile object. If you drop, a dressing across the casualty's skin or it slips after it is in place, the dressing should not be used.Battle DressingsBattle dressings are used most often aboard ship and in the field. Each dressing is complete (no other materials are needed) with four tabs which help in applying and securing the dressing. They have \"other side next to wound\" marked on the outer side. This will help you in placing the sterile side against the wound. Unless contraindicated, to assist in controlling the bleeding, tie the knot of the dressing over the wound.CompressesEmergencies may occur when it is not possible to obtain a sterile compress. During these situations, use the cleanest cloth available, a freshly laundered handkerchief, towel, or shirt. Unfold the material carefully so that you do not touch the part that will be placed against the wound. The compress should be large enough to cover the entire wound and extend at least 1 inch beyond its edges. If a compress is not large enough, the edges of the wound will become contaminated. Materials that will stick to a wound or may be difficult to remove should never be used directly on a wound. Absorbent cotton, adhesive tape, and paper napkins are examples of materials that should never come in contact with a wound.BandagesBandages are strips or rolls of gauze or other materials that are used for wrapping or binding any part of the body and to hold compresses in place. It is not necessary to take time to ensure that the bandage resembles the textbook pictures. However, it is important that the dressing controls the bleeding, prevents further contamination, and protects the wound from further injury. Some of the most commonly used bandages are the roller bandage and the triangular bandage.Roller BandagesThe roller bandage consists of a long strip of material (usually gauze, or elastic) that is rolled and is available in several widths and lengths. Most are sterile, so pieces may be used as a compress on wounds. A strip of roller bandage can be used to make a four-tailed bandage, by splitting the cloth from each end, leaving as large a center as needed. This type of bandage is used to hold a compress on the chin, or the nose.Triangular BandagesTriangular bandages are usually made of muslin. They are useful because they can be folded in a variety of ways to fit almost any part of the body. Padding can be added to areas that may become uncomfortable.The triangular bandage can be folded to make acravat bandage, which is useful in controlling bleeding from wounds of the scalp or forehead. To make a cravat bandage, bring the point of the triangular bandage to the middle of the base and continue to fold until a 2-inch width is obtained. If specially prepared bandages are not available, use whatever material you can find. Remember that the basic purpose of a bandage is to hold the sterile compress in place. Any material or method of application that does not cause further injury to the casualty will be acceptable. Material used as a bandage does not have to be sterile, since it will not come in direct contact with the wound. However, it should be as clean as possible. Cloth bandages should be fastened by tying the ends with a square knot or by tacking the ends with safety pins. If you use a knot to fasten the bandage, be sure to use a square knot. This knot is easy to tie, will not slip, and can be untied quickly. Place the knot so it will cause the least amount of discomfort to the casualty and where it can be removed easily and quickly. Bandages should be applied firmly but not too tight. A loose bandage will slip off the wound. A bandage that is too tight can cut off the blood supply to the injured part and cause damage to the blood vessels and tissues. When you fasten a bandage around an arm or leg, leave the fingers or toes uncovered. If they become blue or swollen, you will know that the bandage is too tight and should be loosened.",
  "Bones, Joints and Muscles": "Accidents cause many different types of injuries to bones, joints and muscles. When rendering first aid, you must be alert for signs of broken bones (fractures), dislocations, sprains, strains, and bruises (contusions). Injuries to the joints and muscles often occur together, and it is difficult to tell whether the injury is to a joint, muscle, or tendon. It is difficult to tell joint or muscle injuries from fractures.When in doubt, always treat the injury as a fracture.The primary process of first aid for fractures consists of immobilizing the injured part to prevent the ends of broken bones from moving and causing further damage to the nerves, blood vessels, or internal organs. Splints are also used to immunize injured joints or muscles and to prevent the enlargement of severe wounds. Before learning first aid for injuries to the bones, joints, and muscles, you need to have a general understanding of the use of splints.SplintsIn an emergency, almost any firm object or material will serve as a splint. Thus, umbrellas, canes, rifles, sticks, oars, wire mesh, boards, cardboard, pillows, and folded newspapers can be used. A fractured leg can be immobilized by securing it to the uninjured leg. Whenever possible, use ready-made splints such as the pneumatic or traction splints.Splints should be lightweight, padded, strong, rigid, and long enough to reach the joint above and below the fracture. If they are not properly padded, they will not adequately immobilize the injured part. Articles of clothing, bandages, blankets, or any soft material may be used as padding. If the casualty is wearing heavy clothes, you may be able to apply the splint on the outside, allowing the clothing to serve as a part of the required padding.Fasten splints in place with bandages, adhesive tape, clothing, or any suitable material. One person should hold the splints in position while another person fastens them.Splints should be applied tight, butnevertight enough to stop the circulation of blood. When applying splints to the arms or legs, leave the fingers or toes exposed. If the tips of the fingers or toes turn blue or cold, loosen the splints or bandages. Injuries will probably swell, and splints or bandages that were applied correctly may later be too tight.FracturesA break or rupture in a bone is called afracture. There are two basic types; open and closed. Aclosed fracturedoes not produce an open wound in the skin, also known as a simple fracture (Fig. 6-lA). Anopen fractureproduces an open wound in the skin, also known as a compound fracture. Open wounds are caused by the sharp end of broken bones pushing through the skin; or by an object such as a bullet that enters the skin from the outside.Open fractures are usually more serious than closed fractures. They involve extensive tissue damage and are likely to become infected. Closed fractures can be turned into open fractures by rough or careless handling of the casualty.Always use extreme care when treating a suspected fracture.It is not easy to recognize a fracture. All fractures, whether open or closed, can cause severe pain or shock. Fractures can cause the injured part to become deformed, or to take an unnatural position. Compare the injured to the uninjured part if you are unsure of a deformity. Pain, discoloration, and swelling may be at the fracture site, and there may be instability if the bone is broken clear through. It may be difficult or impossible for the casualty to move the injured part. If movement is possible, the casualty may feel a grating sensation (crepitus) as the ends of the bones rub against each other. If a bone is cracked rather than broken, the casualty may be able to move the injured part without much difficulty. An open fracture is easy to see if the end of the bone sticks out through the skin. If the bone does not stick out, you might see a wound but fail to see the broken bone. It can be difficult to tell if an injury is a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or strain.When in doubt, splint.If you suspect a fracture, do the following:1.Control bleedingwith direct pressure, indirect pressure, or tourniquetonly as a last resort.2.Treat for shock.3.Monitorthe airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).4.Removeall jewelry from the injury site, unless the casualty objects. Gently cut clothing away so that you don't move the injured part and cause further damage.5.Checkthe distal pulse of the injured part, if pulse is absent, gently move injured part to restore circulation.6.Coverall wounds with sterile dressings, including open fractures.Do not push bone ends back into the skin. Avoid excessive pressure on the wound.7.Apply splint - Do not attempt to straighten broken bones.a. Apply and maintain traction until the splint has been secured.b. Wrap from the bottom of the splint to the top, firmly but not too tight.c. Check the distal pulse to ensure that circulation is still present. If the pulse is absent, loosen the splint until circulation returns.Do not move the casualty until the injury has been splinted.8.Request medical assistance- All suspected fractures require professional medical treatment.Fracture of the ForearmThere are two long bones in the forearm, the radius and the ulna. When both are broken, the arm usually appears to be deformed. When only one is broken, the other acts as a splint and the arm retains a more natural appearance. Fractures usually result in pain, tenderness, swelling, and loss of movement.In addition to the general procedures above, apply a pneumatic (air) splint if available; if not, apply two padded splints; one on the top (backhand side), and one on the bottom (palm side). Make sure the splints are long enough to extend from the elbow to the wrist.Once the forearm is sprinted, place the forearm across the chest. The palm of the hand should be turned in with the thumb pointing up. Support the forearm in this position with a wide sling and cravat bandage. The band should be raised about 4 inches above the level of the elbow.Fracture of the Upper ArmThere is one bone in the upper arm, the humerus. If the fracture is near the elbow, the arm is likely to be straight with no bend at the elbow. Fractures usually result in pain, tenderness, swelling, and loss of movement. In addition to the general procedures above, do the following:If the fracture is in the upper part of the arm, near the shoulder, place a pad or folded towel in the armpit, bandage the arm securely to the body, and support the forearm in a narrow sling. If the fracture is in the middle of the upper arm, you can use one well padded splint on the outside of the arm. The splint should extend from the shoulder to the elbow. Secure the arm firmly to the body and support the forearm in a sling.If the fracture is at or near the elbow, the arm may be either bent or straight. Regardless what position you find the arm,do not attempt to straighten or move it. Gently splint the arm in the position in which you find it.Fracture of the RibMake the casualty as comfortable as possible so that the chances of further damage to the lungs, heart, or chest wall is minimized.A common finding in all casualties with fractured ribs is pain at the site of the fracture. Ask the casualty to point to the exact area of pain to assist you in determining the location of the fracture. Deep breathing, coughing, or movement is usually painful. The casualty should remain still and may lean toward the injured side, with a hand over the fracture to immobilize the chest and ease the pain.Simple rib fractures are not bound, strapped, or taped if the casualty is comfortable. If the casualty is more comfortable with the chest immobilized, use a sling and swathe. Place the arm on the injured side against the chest, with the palm flat, thumb up, and the forearm raised to a 45-degree angle. Immobilize the chest, using wide strips of bandage (ace wrap) to secure the arm to the chest.Fracture of the ThighThere is one long bone in the upper leg between the kneecap and the pelvis, the femur. When the femur is fractured, any attempt to move the leg results in a spasm of the muscles that causes severe pain. The leg is not stable, and there is complete loss of control below the fracture. The leg usually assumes an unnatural position, with the toes pointing outward. The injured leg is shorter than the uninjured one due to the pulling of the thigh muscles. Serious bleeding is a real danger since the broken bone may cut the large (femoral) artery. Shock usually is severe.In addition to the general procedures above, gently straighten the leg, apply two padded splints, one on the outside and inside of the injured leg. The outside splint should reach from the armpit to the foot, the inside splint from the groin to the foot. The splint should be secured in five places: (1) around the ankle, (2) over the knee, (3) just below the hip, (4) around the pelvis, and (5) just below the armpit. The legs can then be tied together to support the injured leg.Do not move the casualty until the leg has been splinted.Fracture of the Lower LegThere are two long bones in the lower leg, the tibia and fibula. When both are broken, the leg usually appears to be deformed. When only one is broken, the other acts as a splint and the leg retains a more natural appearance. Fractures usually result in pain, tenderness, swelling, and loss of movement. A fracture just above the ankle is often mistaken for a sprain.In addition to the general procedures above, gently straighten the leg, apply a pneumatic (air) splint if available; if not, apply three padded splints, one on each side and underneath the leg. Place extra padding (Fig. 6-6) under the knee and just above the heel. The splint should be secured in four places: (1) just below the hip, (2) just above the knee, (3) just below the knee, and (4) just above the ankle.Do not place the straps over the area of the fracture.A pillow and two side splints also work well. Place a pillow beside the injured leg, then gently lift the leg and place it in the middle of the pillow. Bring the edges of the pillow around to the front of the leg and pin them together. Then place one splint on each side of the leg, over the pillow, and secure them in place with a bandage or tape.Fracture of the KneecapThe kneecap is also known as the patella. Although fractures of the kneecap do occur, the more common injuries are dislocations and sprains.In addition to the general procedures above, gently straighten the leg, apply a pneumatic (air) splint if available; if not, apply a padded board under the injured leg. The board should be at least 4 inches wide and should reach from the buttock to the heel. Place extra padding under the knee and just above the heel. The splint should be secured in four places: (1) just below the hip, (2) just above the knee, (3) just below the knee, and (4) just above the ankle.Do not place the straps directly over the kneecap.Fracture of the CollarboneThe collarbone is also known as the clavicle. When standing, the injured shoulder is lower, and the casualty is unable to raise the arm above the shoulder. The casualty attempts to support the shoulder by holding the elbow. This is the typical stance taken by a casualty with a broken collarbone. Since the collarbone lies near the surface of the skin, you may be able to see the point of fracture by the deformity and tenderness.In addition to the general procedures above, gently bend the casualty's arm and place the forearm across the chest. The palm of the hand should be turned in, with the thumb pointing up. Support the arm in this position (Fig. 6-7) with a wide sling. The hand should be raised about 4 inches above the level of the elbow. A wide roller bandage (or any wide strip of cloth) may be used to secure the casualty's arm to the body.Fracture of the JawThe lower jaw is also known as the mandible. The casualty may have difficulty breathing, difficulty in talking, chewing, and swallowing, and have pain of movement of the jaw. The teeth may be out of line, and the gums may bleed, and swelling may develop.The most important consideration is to maintain an adequate open airway.In addition to the general procedures above, apply a four-tailed bandage, be sure the bandage pulls the lower jaw forward. Never apply a bandage that forces the jaw backward, since this may interfere with breathing. The bandage must be firm enough to support and immobilize the lower jaw, but it must not press against the casualty's throat.The casualty should have scissors or a knife to cut the bandage in case of vomiting.Fracture of the SkullThe skull is also known as the cranium. The primary danger is that the brain may be damaged. Whether or not the skull is fractured is of secondary importance. The first aid procedures are the same in either case, and the primary intent is to prevent further damage. Some injuries that fracture the skull do not cause brain damage. But brain damage can result from minor injuries that do not cause damage to the skull.It is difficult to determine whether an injury has affected the brain, because symptoms of brain damage vary. A casualty who has suffered a head injury must be handled carefully and given immediate medical attention.Signs and symptoms that may indicate brain damage include:1. Wounds of the scalp, deformity of the skull.2. Dizziness, weakness, conscious or unconscious.3. Pain, tenderness, or swelling.4. Severe headache, nausea and vomiting.5. Restlessness, confusion, and disorientation.6. Paralysis of the arms, legs, or face.7. Unequal pupils, abnormal reaction to light.8. Blood or clear fluid from the ears, nose, or mouth.9. Pale, flushed skin.10. Bruising behind the ear(Battle's Sign).11. Bruising under or around the eyes in the absence of trauma to the eyes(Raccoon's Sign).If you suspect a head injury, do the following:1.Positionthe casualty flat, stabilize the head and neck as you found them by placing your hands on both sides of the head.2.Establish and maintain an open airway- jaw-thrust maneuver. Note that the head is not tilted and the neck is not extended. Check the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).3.Finger sweepto remove any foreign bodies from the mouth.4.Maintainneutral position of head and neck and, if possible, apply a cervical collar or improvised (towel) collar.5.Apply dressing- Do not use direct pressure or tie knots over the wound. Apply ice or cold packs if available. (For blood or clear fluid from the nose or ears, cover loosely with a sterile dressing to absorb but not stop the flow).6.Treat for shock- Casualties with suspected head and neck injuries are to remain flat.Do not raise the casualty's feet. If they are vomiting or bleeding around the mouth, place them on their side keeping the neck straight.Do not give anything to eat or drink.7.Request medical assistance immediately- Time is critical.Head and neck injuries should be treated by professional medical personnel, if possible. Do not attempt procedures that you are not trained to do.Fracture of the SpineThe spine is also known as the backbone or spinal column. If the spine is fractured, the spinal cord may be crushed, cut, or damaged so severely that death or paralysis may occur. If the fracture occurs in a way that the spinal cord is not damaged, there is a chance of complete recovery. Twisting or bending of the neck or back, whether due to the original injury or careless handling, is likely to cause irreparable damage. The primary symptoms of a fractured spine are pain, shock, and paralysis. Pain may be acute at the point of fracture and radiate to other parts of the body. Shock is usually severe, but the symptoms may be delayed. Paralysis occurs if the spinal cord is damaged. If the casualty cannot move the legs, the injury is probably in the back; if the arms and legs cannot move, the injury is probably in the neck.A casualty who has back or neck pain following an injury should be treated for a fractured spine.If you suspect a fractured spine, do the following:1.Positionthe casualty flat, stabilize the head and neck as you found them by placing your hands on both sides of the head.2.Establish and maintain an open airway- jaw-thrust maneuver. Note that the head is not tilted and the neck is not extended. Check the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).3.Finger sweepto remove any foreign bodies from the mouth.4.Maintainneutral position of head and neck and, if possible, apply a cervical collar or improvised (towel) collar.5. Keep the casualty comfortable and warm enough to maintain normal body temperature.6.Treat for shock- Casualties with suspected spinal injuries are to remain flat.Do not raise the casualty's feet. If the casualty is vomiting or bleeding around the mouth, place them on their side keeping the neck straight.Do not give anything to eat or drink.7.Request medical assistance immediately- Time is critical.Do not move the casualty unless it is absolutely necessary. Do not bend or twist the casualty's body. Do not move the head forward, backward, or sideways. Do not allow the casualty to sit up.Fracture of the PelvisFractures often result from falls, heavy blows, and crushing accidents. The greatest danger is damage to the organs that are enclosed by the pelvis. There is danger that the bladder will be ruptured or that severe internal bleeding may occur, due to the large blood vessels being torn by broken bone. The primary symptoms are severe pain, shock, and loss of the ability to use the lower part of the body. The casualty is unable to sit or stand and may feel like the body is \"coming apart.\"Treat for shock, but do not raise the casualty's feet. Do not move the casualty unless absolutely necessary. Request medical assistance immediately.DislocationsAdislocationoccurs when a bone is forcibly displaced from its joint. Many times the bone slips back into its normal position; other times, it becomes locked and remains dislocated until it is put back into place (reduction). Dislocations are caused by falls or blows and occasionally by violent muscular exertion. The joints that are most frequently dislocated are the shoulder, hip, finger, and jaw.A dislocation may bruise or tear muscles, ligaments, blood vessels, and tendons. The primary symptoms are rapid swelling, discoloration, loss of movement, pain, and shock.You should not attempt to reduce a dislocation. Unskilled attempts at reduction may cause damage to the nerves and blood vessels or may fracture a bone. You should leave this treatment to professional medical personnel and concentrate your efforts on making the casualty comfortable.If you suspect a dislocation, do the following:1. Loosen clothing from around the injury.2. Place the casualty in the most comfortable position.3. Support the injured part with a sling, pillow, or splint.4. Treat for shock.5. Request medical assistance as soon as possible.SprainsAsprainis an injury to the ligaments that support a joint. It usually involves a sudden dislocation, with the bone slipping back into place on its own. Sprains are caused by the violent pulling or twisting of the joint beyond its normal limits of movement. The joints that are most frequently sprained are the ankle, wrist, knee, and finger. Tearing of the ligaments is the most serious aspect of a sprain, and there is a considerable amount of damage to the blood vessels. When the blood vessels are damaged, blood may escape into the joint, causing pain and swelling.If you suspect a sprain, do the following:1.Splintto support the joint and put the ligaments at rest. Gently loosen the splint if it becomes so tight that it interferes with circulation.2.Elevate & restthe joint to help reduce the pain and swelling.3.Applyice or cold packs, with cloth to prevent damage to the skin, the first 24 hours, then apply warm compresses to increase circulation.4.Request medical assistanceas soon as possible.Treat all sprains as fractures until ruled out by x-rays.StrainsAstrainis caused by the forcible over-stretching or tearing of a muscle or tendon. They are caused by lifting heavy loads, sudden or violent movements, or by any action that pulls the muscles beyond their normal limits. The primary symptoms are pain, lameness, stiffness, swelling, and discoloration.If you suspect a strain, do the following:1.Elevate & restthe injured area to help reduce the pain and swelling.2.Applyice or cold packs, with cloth to prevent damage to the skin, the first 24 hours, then apply warm compresses to increase circulation.3.Request medical assistanceas soon as possible.Treat all strains as fractures until ruled out by x-rays.ContusionsAcontusion(bruise) is an injury that causes bleeding into or beneath the skin, but it does not break the skin. The primary symptoms are pain, tenderness, swelling, and discoloration. At first, the injured area is red due to local irritation; as time passes the characteristic \"black and blue\" (ecchymosis) mark appears. Several days after the injury, the skin becomes yellow or green in color. Usually, minor contusions do not require treatment.If you suspect a contusion, do the following:1.Elevate & restthe injured area to help reduce the pain and swelling.2.Applyice or cold packs, with cloth to prevent damage to the skin, the first 24 hours, then apply warm compresses to increase circulation.3.Request medical assistanceas soon as possible.The preceding information has been provided by the Department of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, titled Operational Medicine 2001 Standard First Aid Course (NAVEDTRA 13119US).",
  "Why Should I Care about Soils?": "A Construction Supervisor might say, \u201cSoil engineering and geology? I\u2019m not an engineer and certainly not a geologist, why would I care about this stuff?\u201d The practical uses for a basic understanding of soils engineering and geology might surprise that silly Construction Supervisor. For example, the placing of soil fill on a site generally requires testing the compaction. Most Construction Supervisors know that a \u201cProctor test\u201d is used and that compaction usually has to be over 95%. But what does it really mean if well placed soil tests at 88% or even at 103%?Unless the Construction Supervisor has a basic understanding of soil engineering, he can appear foolish. If the soil tests over 100% and he laughs at the impossibility of compaction over 100%, those that understand the test know that the Construction Supervisor doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s always best not to look like a fool, at least not too many times in one day.",
  "How to Understand a Soil Compaction Proctor Test?": "The Proctor test can be understood easily. A soil sample gets taken in the field and dried in the lab. The dry soil then gets divided into different piles, with each pile getting a different amount of water added. So at this point, the lab technician has several soil samples at different moisture levels (say, 12%, 14%, 16%, 18%, 20%).Each of these soil samples (for a standard Proctor test) is then pounded with a 5.5 pound weight dropping on it\u00a0 20 times from a height of 12 inches. Of course, the dropping of the weight compacts the soil. To compact soil means to make it more dense. Density is defined as the weight divided by the volume. So each of these compacted soil samples is tested for density. The results are graphed on a Proctor test density chart. The figure below shows a typical set of data.The results seen on the graph tend to correspond with common sense field observations. With too little moisture, soil doesn\u2019t compact too well. By adding some moisture to the compaction process, the soil certainly gets much more firm (i.e. doesn\u2019t deflect or pump under a heavy weight like a truck tire). If too much moisture gets into the soil, as in the case after heavy rains, the soil will simply not compact well.These common sense observations lead to the conclusion that there is an optimal amount of moisture in soil for good compaction to take place. The example graph shows that optimal amount to be 14%. Reading down the graph, the highest density obtained in this test is 118 pounds per cubic foot.\u00a0 So Figure 1 shows the data from a standard Proctor test. But how does that data get used to determine allowable soil densities and moisture contents?Simple arithmetic. The highest point on that graph becomes the 100% density and the optimal moisture level. The 95% density and the upper and lower moisture limits are calculated in the figure. The 95% allowable density is 112 pounds per cubic foot and the upper and lower moisture levels are read off the chart..Just knowing that information about the test, the Construction Supervisor has some useful knowledge. Is it possible to have compaction above 100%? Of course it is. Compacting a soil sample in the lab certainly doesn\u2019t lead to the conclusion that the density achieved is the highest possible density.An astute Construction Supervisor realizes that several factors could be in play here:The amount of force put on the soil in the field, under a heavy roller compacting machine, might be more than was used in the laboratory.The soil tested in the laboratory is probably not identical to the soil being tested in the field (since soil by its nature is not completely uniform).There could be a mistake in the lab testing or in the field testing.These conclusions flow from a simple understanding of the nature of soils and the Proctor testing. The Construction Supervisor who understands these issues does his job better.A bit more understanding of the Proctor test yields some additional information. Many specification books require the soil to be compacted to 95% of modified Proctor testing (ASTM D 1557). This standard uses a 10 pound hammer and an 18\u201d drop. The modified Proctor soil testing is best suited for a heavily compacted base course or the sub-grade for an airfield pavement.Therefore the modified Proctor soil testing is generally too stringent a standard for earthwork associated with low rise commercial, residential and industrial buildings. The use of this standard with 95% density specified typically penalizes the project with delays since this density is difficult to achieve when soils are wet.",
  "How are Soils Classified?": "Any competent Construction Supervisor should know the basic characteristics of the soil under the project being built. Trench cave-ins, muddy site conditions, dusty site conditions, settlement of structures, settlement of soil backfill and other soil related problems can all aggravate the Construction Supervisor on a project. Some of those problems can go beyond aggravations to huge problems. So learn about soil classifications.Soils are divided into coarse grained and fine grained, depending on the size of the soil particles. The following simple chart shows the basics of coarse grained soils:FIELD IDENTIFICATION OF COURSE GRAINED SOILSTable 2Soil NameApproximate Size LimitsCommon ExampleBoulders3\" or greaterOrange, Grapefruits, WatermelonsCoarse Gravel3/4\" to 3\"Grape to OrangeFine Gravel1/4\" to 3/4\"Pea to GrapeCourse Sand1/16\" to 1/4\"Rock SaltMedium Sand1/64\" to 1/16\"Table SaltFine Sand.003\" to 1/64\"SugarFine sand particles are the smallest soil individual grain that can be seen with the naked eye. Fine grained soils, which are silts and clays, cannot be seen individually without a magnifying glass.So the Construction Supervisor can get a sense of the size of the soil particles just by grabbing a handful of soil and looking at it closely. The sizes of the various soil particles are noted as well as noting if the particles are too small to see. Since the four basic soil components are gravel, sand, silt and clay, the Construction Supervisor can determine if the soil is mostly gravel or sand or a clay/silt just by looking at it.The next important soil classification regards cohesion. A cohesive soil sticks together, it has strong bonds between the individual soil particles. Clays tend to be cohesive soils. A simple field test for cohesion involves grabbing a small handful of the soil and rolling it between two hands, trying to create a long, thin thread (think worm or small snake). If the soil sample rolls into a narrow thread (say 4\u201d long and 1/8\u201d thick) it has a high degree of cohesion and is probably mostly clay. If the sample just breaks apart as it begins to roll into the thread, it has much less cohesion and is mostly silt.In soils the concept of cohesive and non-cohesive is very important. In cohesive soils particles stick together (cohesive literally means mutual attraction between particles. These soils, clays and silts, can generally be squeezed in one's hand to form a ball. Conversely if one squeezes a handful of sand or gravel, there will be no cohesion. Clays may be distinguished from silts by using the following simple tests.Dry Strength Test: Mold a small brick of soil and allow it air dry. Break the brick and place a small (1/8\") fragment between thumb and finger. A silt fragment will break easily whereas clay will not.Dilatancy Test: Mix a small sample with water to form a thick slurry. When the sample is squeezed, water will flow back into a silty sample quickly. The return rate will be much lower for clay.Plasticity Test: Roll a moist soil sample into a thin (l/8\") thread. As the thread dries, silt will be weak and friable, but clay will be tough.Dispersion Test: Dispense a sample of soil in water. Measure the time for the particles to settle. Sand will settle in 30 to 60 seconds. Silt will settle in 15 to 60 minutes, and clay will remain in suspension for a long time.While these tests certainly do not have to be performed by the Construction Supervisor on every project for every soil, they\u00a0 are frequently helpful. A Construction Supervisor should understand these classifications because soil is literally the base of every construction project.",
  "What are Soil Boring \rLogs?": "The soil boring logs typically done for a project provide a few valuable pieces of information for the Construction Supervisor. First, the soil classification is given. For example, \u201cclayey sand\u201d means that the soil is mostly sand, but significant amounts of clay as well. If the report says \u201cclayey sand with trace gravel\u201d it means the soil also has small amounts of gravel sized soil in the clayey sand.What would a clayey sand with trace amounts of gravel look and feel like in the Construction Supervisor\u2019s hand? From the procedures noted above, the handful of soil would look sandy, grain sizes from sugar to rock salt would be visible. But there would also be some of the soil in which the grain size was too small to see. When the Construction Supervisor rolls out the sample into a thread, it would hand together for a while (showing cohesion) but than break apart because of the larger part of cohesionless sand. The trace gravel would just be some random larger rocks visible in the soil.Of course, soil test in the laboratory provide much more accurate classification for a given sample. A good Construction Supervisor, though, knows how to quickly verify in the field that the soil sample described in the soils report is similar to what is in his hands. The ability to realize when the excavation has uncovered different soils from the lab report can prevent costly settlement errors and even prevent fatalities from trench cave-ins.Soil classification is important for many reasons on a construction project. Primarily the geotechnical engineer classifies the soil in order to design the foundation system. The Construction Supervisor specifically should be aware of soil classification for the following reasons:The type of soil greatly affects the degree of danger for trench cave-ins.The on-site subgrade dewatering system is dependant on the type of soil.The best method for dealing with wet, muddy conditions or dry, dusty conditions on a project depends on the type of soil involved.The compaction requirements and methods for backfill and embankments change for different types of soils.Soil is often the hardest to predict and most difficult to work with material on a construction project. Unlike steel, aluminum, glass, cement, etc., soil as a construction material tends to be nonhomogeneous (material properties vary widely within a sample). So it pays to understand soils.",
  "Why Should I Worry about Organic Soils?": "Organic soils represent a significant danger for the long-term use of the building, as well as short term safety issues. Simply stated, organic soils are not structurally sound, so they can\u2019t be used for foundation bearing and they can\u2019t be relied on to not cave-in as trench walls.In the 1980s I was working on a 200 year old stone building on an Army base which showed signs of significant foundation settlement. The general question was, \u201cWhat could possibly be settling after 200 years?\u201d Soil borings and analysis showed organic material (topsoil) that was under the original building foundations. That topsoil continued to decompose all these years, continuing to settle the building. Organic soils just can\u2019t be allowed under buildings.An astute Construction Supervisor keeps an eye on the excavation, looking for soil changes that could cause project problems. Different geographical areas have different types of organic soils: there is topsoil, peat, etc. Organic soils are characterized by dark colors, the order of decomposition, spongy or fibrous texture, and visible particles of vegetable matter.",
  "What Should I Know about Soil Slope Stability?": "Instability of soil slopes causes problems in both permanent and temporary slopes. The geotechnical engineering required to calculate slope stability is difficult, expensive and inexact (due to the non-homogenous nature of soils). As a result many permanent soil slopes and most temporary soil slopes become a \"field condition,\" never analyzed, and considered the Construction Supervisor\u2019s problem. Soil slopes are tricky to understand and frequent failures makes it vital that the Construction Supervisor understand their nature.There are two key things to remember. Slope instability is caused by increased stress or a reduced strength in the soil. Some significant factors are as follows:1.Increased stressa.Increased unit weight of soil wettingb.Added external loads (buildings, spoil piles, etc.).c.Steeper slopes by excavation or natural erosiond.Applied shock loads2.Reduced\u00a0 strengtha.Absorption of waterb.Shock or cyclic loadsc.Freeze/thaw actiond.Loss of cementing materialse.Weathering processIt is noteworthy that water both increases stress and reduces strength, and is thereby a factor in most slope failures.",
  "What Practical Geology Should I Know?": "Geological science may appear to be of slight importance to a Construction Supervisor involved in all the practical details of building a project. However a basic knowledge of geology allows a Construction Supervisor to evaluate rock slope stability, rock excavation methods and equipment, as well as geological hazards such as sinkholes and landslides. Skilled application of this information invariably contributes to a projects success. Ignorance can just as surely lead to failure.For example, one Construction Supervisor, given the problem of a small sinkhole near a footing, may ignore the problem. Later that sinkhole, by undermining the foundation, causes the building to collapse. A better-informed Construction Supervisor will deal with the problem at the onset, with a minimal cost, and continue the project on track. Therefore, gaining and using geological information properly is a tremendous aid to success.As one may remember from high school earth science classes, rock is classified as either igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. Igneous rocks form by the cooling of the molten magma\u00a0 found deep beneath the surface of the earth. There are two types of igneous rocks. Intrusive igneous rock consists of molten magma that remains far beneath the earth's surface, cools slowly and consequently contains large crystals (such as granite). Extrusive igneous rock erupts at the earth's surface, as a lava flow, for example, and cools rapidly into small crystals (such as pumice).The second class of rocks, sedimentary,\u00a0 is the consolidated and cemented product of the disintegration and decomposition by weathering of igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic rocks. Mechanical cementation or chemical precipitation at the earth's surface produces the actual sedimentary rock. For example sandstone is literally a cemented material, sand, formed into rock. Small decomposed rock particles, such as sand, are commonly transported by the wind or by a river. As these particles land, or settle to the bottom, and they form a horizontal layer. Mechanical or chemical cementation then forms this layer of sand into rock. This rock would be considered to have a horizontal bedding. It is common, however, to see layers of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, to be vertical or inclined rather then horizontal. The limestone was formed with horizontal bedding, but as the crust of the earth moves and deforms (over millions of years) the rock layers may be tilted, folded or faulted.Metamorphic rocks are formed from existing igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic rocks by heat and pressure below the earth's surface. The forming of igneous and metamorphic rock may reverse itself. For example, limestone, a sedimentary rock, can be changed to marble, a metamorphic rock, by heat and pressure below the earth's surface. To review, then, igneous rocks form from molten magma found deep beneath the earth; sedimentary rocks cement small decomposed rock particles together; and heat and pressure below the earth's surface changes other rocks into metamorphic rock.",
  "How Can Knowing about Rock Formations Help \rMe?": "The ability to field identify rocks on a project may be interesting for a Construction Supervisor, however rock identification, by itself, has very limited value. The true usefulness of understanding geology comes as the Construction Supervisor receives information on rock formations. The formation is the conventional unit for geologic mapping for the United States Geologic Survey (USGS).Formation is defined as an individual rock or combination of rocks sufficiently distinctive to be given a name. State or local governments often have excellent technical information concerning rock formations. An example of how this information becomes available and useful is shown below.Assume there is a large, industrial building project in Central Pennsylvania with complete plans and specifications available. A state government geologic map indicates the project site sits above the Richland Formation. The PA Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey publishes an inexpensive book titledEngineering Characteristics of the Rocks of Pennsylvaniawhich has the following information.Richland FormationDescription: gray, finely/crystalline dolomite; medium gray, oolitic limestone; chert; calcarenite; and conglomerate.Bedding: well bedded; thick.Fracturing: joints have a blocky patter; well developed; moderate to highly abundant; regularly spaced with a moderate distance between fractures; open and steeply dipping.Weathering: moderate resistant; slightly weathered to a shallow depth; decomposition results in medium size, blocky fragments; overlying mantle is usually thick; interface between bedrock and mantle is pinnacle.Topography: undulating valley of low relief; natural slopes are gentle and stable.Drainage: good subsurface drainage; little surface drainage.Porosity: solution channels produce a secondary porosity of low to medium magnitude.Ground water: where studied, median specific capacity is 2.4 gallons per minute of drawdown.Ease of excavation: requires blasting; bedrock pinnacles a special problem; moderate to slow drilling rates with rotary equipment; numerous sandstone beds and chert lenses slow drilling rate.Cut-slope Stability: good cut-slope stability, stable in near vertical cuts.Foundation Stability: good quality foundation for heavy structures; a thorough sinkhole investigation should be undertaken.Construction materials: good for road material, riprap, building stone, embankment facing, and fill.There is a wealth of information here for the Construction Supervisor. The fracturing, weathering and ease of excavation sections allow the Construction Supervisor and Excavation Contractor to choose the best equipment and method for excavation. Also, production rates can be more accurately calculated for the project schedule. The sections on drainage, porosity and groundwater yield excellent information with which to make dewatering decisions. The cut-slope stability section helps the Construction Supervisor feel comfortable in this area. It seems clear that rock formation information increases the chances for success on a project.A contractor would be prudent, then, to obtain geologic information for every project undertaken. To incorporate this item into the project start-up is simple, and much of the information can be gathered by a construction secretary.Many difficult decisions concerning the site geology are left to the Construction Supervisor and subcontractors. For example a foundation excavation may expose a steep rock slope. Geotechnical engineers struggle with the difficult problem of determining the stability of rock slope. In most cases, though, the Construction Supervisor and Excavation Contractor must determine if the rock slope is safe or must be cut back further. The lives of workmen, and the success of the project, are tied together in that decision. Information about other geological hazards such as landslides, sinkholes, earthquakes, etc. can be found in government publications.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Soils and \rGeology:": "Obtain soil information at the start of a project. Get a copy of any soil boring or testing reports. Get government soil information if available for the site. Always know what soils you have on a site and their basic characteristics (how they compact, how they act when too wet or when too dry, their stability as a trench wall, etc.)Obtain rock formation information at the start of a project, understand the basic characteristics of the rock (ease of excavation, slope stability, drainage, ground water flows, etc.).When considering soil slope stability, remember that water both adds to the weight and reduces the soil strength (a double whammy).When encountering problems with soil compaction, always consider if the soil sample that was tested in the laboratory is the same as the soil being compacted in the field.",
  "Why Pay Attention to Sitework?": "On too many projects, the Construction Supervisor allows the Excavation Foreman to make most of the major decisions for the site work staging and planning. It seems to make sense to allow the Excavation Foreman to make these decisions, since his crews are doing the work. This assumption causes many problems on projects that could have been easily avoided.The Excavation Foreman generally focuses on the most efficient method to get his required work items done. Generally the excavator's goals can be visualized if the dirt were being moved with a stick; pushed from the high areas to the nearest low areas with a minimum of carrying. Sometimes the most efficient method for the Excavation Foreman is also the best plan for the entire project. Many times, though, project complexities exist that are beyond the excavator\u2019s scope of work. In these cases, the Construction Supervisor should make sure the planning considers what is best for the entire project, not just for the Excavator.A simple method that works well involves a color marked site plan that the Construction Supervisor develops just for job staging and planning. The Construction Supervisor needs to consider fill pile locations, topsoil pile locations, haul roads, building layout points, building material storage locations, parking areas, office trailer locations, etc for the various phases of the project.Perhaps several color marked up site plans will be needed to show what happens at the various project stages. Each project is different and requires a slightly different approach. But the one consistent rule: lack of site work planning for the various project stages by the Construction Supervisor will definitely not achieve an optimized project.A good Construction Supervisor considers the various requirements for foundation, site utilities, access and storage, dewatering, etc. and helps plan a detailed sequence of excavation. This planning process should include as many of the effected parties as possible to insure success. Be forewarned, it will be difficult to get people to take the time to plan. Planning, by definition, involves taking uncertain dates and requirements and looking into the future to make decisions. Many people are uncomfortable with this process and will try to avoid it. Good planning requires thought and negotiating and is hard mental work.",
  "How Erosion and Sedimentation Control Starts the Project?": "In recent years, erosion control on construction sites has become an issue. Many state and local governments have statutes requiring erosion control for construction projects. Often inspectors have the authority to shut-down an entire project for erosion control concerns. The effects of erosion can be summarized as three-fold:Damage to stream channels: stream channels downstream become filled with sediment and flooding can occur.Damage to water: sediment lowers water quality for municipal and industrial use.Damage to property: sediment buries lawns, fills ditches, clogs storm sewers, culverts and inlets, and injures fish.Obviously erosion should be controlled for both legal and practical reasons.Erosion is defined as the detachment and transportation of soil particles. Rain falling on bare soil detaches particles and as the rainwater runs off soil erosion occurs in proportion to the water volume and velocity. The eroded soil particles are deposited when the water slows and the soil particles settle.Erosion can be controlled through both mechanical and vegetable measures. One of the most effective mechanical measures involves grading, or disturbing, only those areas immediately needed for construction. Limiting the area of exposed, bare soil greatly reduces erosion. This method of erosion control can often appear to be at odds with the excavator's goal of completing the project quickly and efficiently. Adequate planning of the grading work, which always involves considering several different options, may reveal a solution that meets both the goals of erosion control and efficient grading.Subsurface trench drains, discussed in the groundwater section of this chapter, are another means of controlling erosion. Trench drains can divert water at the top of a slope or collect and carry fast moving water away at the bottom of a slope. Swales and berms can also be used to divert and channel run-off. Before leaving the site, this run-off must be slowed to allow the sediment to settle. Sediment basins are used to detain runoff and trap sediment. A well constructed sediment basin should have capacity to hold adequate runoff, prevent runoff short-circuits past the basin, and be accessible to clean-out sediment.Vegetative measures to reduce erosion control can be very efficient and economical. The slope of the site and fertility of the soil help determine the effectiveness of vegetative measures. Straw, or other fibrous, mulch can be applied directly to soil slopes during an unfavorable time of year for seeding. Straw mulches are usually applied at 1-1/2tons per acre. Straw mulching must be anchored asphalt tack spray, straight blade, disking, or netting.There are times in the year when permanent seeding is prohibited, but temporary seeding may be successful. Annual rye grass, small grain, sudangrass and millet are often used for temporary seeding and, with a little luck from the elements, do an excellent job of preventing erosion. The ideal situation, generally, is to install permanent seeding as soon as grading is complete in an area. If required, sod can be placed in almost any weather conditions and can reduce erosion almost immediately.",
  "What You Should Know about Clearing and Grubbing?": "The process of removing and disposing of brush and trees is described as clearing. Grubbing is defined as removal and disposal of stumps and roots. Clearing and grubbing is generally performed concurrently in order to ready the site for topsoil stripping and bulk excavation. Since clearing and grubbing happens as the first work item on the project, it is usually critical to the project schedule. Therefore, the Construction Supervisor needs to understand the process of clearing and grubbing in order to control the project.Clearing and grubbing is often thought of as a simple process, but there are many options and complexities involved. There are several methods of disposing of brush, trees and stumps, depending on project conditions and local ordinances. Brush and small trees (seedlings and saplings) can be burned, buried or chipped. In order to discuss tree usage it is helpful to use the U.S. Forest Service size classification.Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diameter in inches at breast height or (DBH)Seedlings\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0\u201d to 3\u201dSaplings\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3\u201dto 4\u201dPoles\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4\u201d to 12\u201dStandards\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\u201d to 24\u201dVeterans\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over 24\u201dPoles may be burned, buried, salvaged for future use or sold.

State environmental laws and local ordinances should be checked. If burning is allowed, it can be an efficient and low cost way of disposing of brush, trees and stumps. Usually a good, hot fire can be started with brush and small trees. Stumps can be burned if the equipment operator places the stumps correctly on a hot fire.Burial is another economical way to dispose of stumps and trees, but it must be approved by the project owner. Be aware that large stump holes, which are often filled in with loose, un-compacted soil, become settlement problems. Don't allow the Sitework Contractor to just bury at the most convenient spot, causing a later problem for you or the Owner.The actual procedure of burying stumps and logs is straight-forward although considerable care should be given to the location of buried items. The simple process of installing a conduit 4\u2019-0\u201d below grade can turn into a huge mess if one runs into a buried stump or tree. As this is often a problem that one subcontractor unwittingly creates for another, the Construction Supervisor should be aware about the burying of material on the project site. Chipping, hauling away and sales to a lumber mill are also methods of disposal. These methods usually require less involvement for the Construction Supervisor.While considering the clearing and grubbing, keep the following items in mind: amount and type of trees and brush, dangers from dead limbs, soil conditions when wet, possibility of working over frozen soil, and general access to the site.",
  "What to Consider for Site and Building Demolition?": "Site demolition includes removal of catch basins, manholes, underground pipe, asphalt paving, concrete paving, etc. The method of disposal of site demolition materials can have a large impact on a project. If the material is hauled to a dump site, the Construction Supervisor should know the dump site location and be assured that the dumping meets all state and local ordinances.I've had a major project can be stopped because a neighbor to the dump site complained and found that we didn't have the proper permits. It is simply not enough, in today's environment, to merely get permission of the landowner to place fill on their property.If site demolition materials are also disposed on site (either buried or broken and used for rip rap) the Design Professional or Owner should give requirements for this type of use (i.e. maximum size of fill lift, equipment used to compact, maximum size piece allowable, requirements for wood, rebar, etc. found in the materials, etc.).Another important question concerning site demolition work is limits of work. The Construction Supervisor should be clear on what the limits are, who is responsible for establishing those limits in the field and who will be responsible for damages if those limits are exceeded. Limits should also be established for specific items of demolition. For example if a catch basin and storm pipe crossing an existing street must be removed, the Construction Supervisor should help determine if the pavement will be chisel cut or saw cut and the width of the cut. The Construction Supervisor can be very effective by keeping the information flowing if one subcontractor performs demolition and another restoration.Building demolition can vary from removing some doors or walls in an existing structure to razing an entire building. The work is extremely varied and runs from the simple to the complex. Understand the demolition requirements before you start!Building demolition work is usually not well understood at the onset of a project. Describing the work to be performed is necessarily tricky because it normally involves areas of unknowns. For example, it's difficult to know the material inside a wall that support a lintel. Regardless of the unknowns, the Construction Supervisor must work to clarify the intent of the demolition work. Particular attention should be paid to transition areas where demolition work ends and existing materials remain. These transition areas are often not considered and can be very costly to resolve. Lastly, the Construction Supervisor must understand the contracted responsibilities for demolition and try to reveal and resolve changes as soon as possible.One item that requires special mention regarding building demolition is hazardous materials. Due to the technical, health and legal problems involved, asbestos, lead paint, or any other hazardous material should be removed by qualified, licensed personnel only. The liabilities are so huge with these materials that the Construction Supervisor should defer decisions in this area to his employer.Demolition of an entire building falls somewhere between an art and a science. Usually the responsibility will be let to one subcontractor. The Construction Supervisor should understand the method to be used, precautions used to project neighboring buildings, techniques, if any, of monitoring of neighboring buildings for damage, dump site location and requirements, and proposed finish condition of site for next contractor to begin work.",
  "What You should Know about Earthwork Excavation and Compaction?": "Earth excavation and grading can be a fascinating part of a construction project. The powerful heavy equipment, used to best advantage by a skilled operator, is a joy to behold. The scope of the excavation job varies from digging footings for a small building to moving millions of cubic yards of earth. The one thing all excavation jobs have in common, though, is that careful planning is the key to success.There are several terms which should be defined. Excavation is often used as a broad term which includes cut (or excavation) and fill (or embankment). Cut is defined as removing material to lower the elevation of an area. Fill is defined as placing material to raise the elevation of an area. Compaction must take place during a fill operation to increase the density of the soil material being placed. Another common breakdown in excavation work is bulk excavation and trench excavation.Swell and shrinkage are two important, and often misunderstood, terms. Consider the simple example of digging a 1.0 cubic yard hole with a shovel and throwing the dirt into wheelbarrows. In the ground the 1.0 cubic yard of soil is in its virgin (or natural) state. Upon being shoveled into the wheelbarrows the soil is in a loose (or lower density) state and probably has a volume of 1.2 to 1.4 cubic yards. This process of soil increasing in volume from its virgin state to a loose state is called swell.Shrinkage, on the other hand, occurs when that same soil is placed back in the one cubic yard hole and is properly compacted. Depending on the soil type, the final volume could be 0.9 cubic yards or 1.1 cubic yards. The above explains why when one digs and refills a hole, sometimes there is not enough soil to fill the hole and sometimes there is soil left over.An excellent table showing weights, swell factors, and shrinkage factors for various materials is included below. The table of characteristics is a growing body of knowledge with many contributors over the past 100 years. All the values given are necessarily approximate. The rock materials are labeled in the following way: I, igneous; S, sedimentary; or M, metamorphic. The cubic yard in cut column assumes natural moisture and has + 10 percent variation. The cubic yard loose column has a +33 percent variation. For example, damp clay with a given swell of 40 percent should be assumed to have a swell range of 30 percent to 53.2 percent. The cubic yard in fill column also has a 33 percent variation and assumes mechanical compaction at appropriate moisture levels.In earth excavation and site grading some of the most common problems encountered are improper compaction, incorrect final elevations, and working beyond the specified area to be disturbed. There are no magic, simple answers or procedures to make the above problems not happen.Improper soil compaction is a common, and often difficult problem.Soil Engineering and Geology, a previous section, discusses the technical aspects of soil compaction. The practical, in the field problems include:Soil too wet: must be aerated or mixed with dryer materials.Soil to dry: must add waterSoil lifts for compaction too deep: lessen lift depthDifferent types of soil: check if the proctor test (the test which measures the density of the soil sample for other tests to be measured against) matches the type of soil encounteredThe soils inspector holds-up the compaction operations to takes tests: try to create a team environment and plan test taking for everyone\u2019s advantage.The problems of incorrect final elevations and working beyond the specified contract limits are more straight-forward. The excavation contractor certainly should be responsible for their own work, the only real problem involves determining the mistake. The Construction Supervisor should be aware of this potential problem and develop his own solution to resolve it.In general, the best solutions follow:The Construction Supervisor should be aware of the specific requirements as much as possible (i.e. understand the whole job) and spot check on occasions.Whenever practical the subcontractors following the site grading should check and accept the previous work prior to beginning.Even though the excavation contractor is ultimately responsible for their work, project schedule or quality can be ruined if errors are found too late.\u00a0 The above are some problems encountered in the field with possible solutions. In many cases the solutions seem simple to apply but are quite difficult and costly. Regardless of the complexity, the site work is almost always critical to the timely completion of the project and must be a priority for the Construction Supervisor.",
  "What are the Basic Pieces of Site Equipment on a Project?": "The advances in our ability to move earth and rock since the early 1900's is truly impressive. It\u2019s a joy to watch a skilled operator produce on one of these technically evolved machines. Bud Caldwell, a great Construction Superintendent from the 1950s to the 1980s, remembered construction before the heavy equipment.\"As a boy, I helped with earthmoving on construction projects. There was a steel scoop with two handles that could be pulled like a plow. I'd hook-up the team of mules to this scoop and drive through the excavation area, scraping a couple of inches of soil at each pass. It was a slow process. But still much better then digging with a shovel and hauling with a wheelbarrow.\"The mules are now replaced with diesel engines and the scoop has been transformed to perform many specialized tasks. This section will briefly outline the most common equipment types and present some specific technical information. Though it is the Site Contractor's job to thoroughly understand the function, cost and maintenance of the equipment; the Construction Supervisor should understand basic heavy equipment characteristics and uses to help plan the job. This review of equipment in not comprehensive, but rather an introduction to commonly used heavy equipment on building projects.TheBulldozeris a simple, versatile machine that has a tremendous number of uses. Generally a self-propelled track machine, the bulldozer pushes or pulls only. Conversely, a front end loader uses a front bucket to lift soil to load a truck. The bulldozer uses include:Clearing and grubbingGrading earth for short haul distancesPushing scraper pansRipping rockSpreading borrow fillGeneral site maintenanceThe sizes of bulldozers vary greatly from small machines that use 6-way tilt blades for fine grading to huge machines that need special permits to be hauled over bridges. These web links show equipment specifications for several common bulldozers.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7TheFront-end Loaderis another versatile piece of equipment, found on most projects at one time or another. Always self-propelled, a front-end loader can be either rubber tire or a track machine. A front-end loader has a front bucket that tilts vertically to load and unload and lifts vertically. The front-end loader uses include:Clearing and grubbingExcavate and carry soilExcavate and load soil into a truckGrading and spreading borrow (although less ideal then a bulldozer)On-site material transport (rebar, pumps, etc.)Particular attention should be paid when a front-end loader excavates and loads soil onto a truck. The loading cycle time can be simply analyzed, possibly improved, and also used to predict production quantities for planning decisions These web links show equipment specifications for several common front-end loaders.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7Scrapers or Pansexcavate soil in one location, haul and dump the soil in another spot. It is difficult to match the efficiency of scrapers for cut/fill soil operation if the haul distance is less then a mile. Scrapers are generally pulled by a rubber tire wheel tractor and are sometimes pushed through the cut area by a bulldozer. These web links show equipment specifications for several common scrapers.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7There are many times that scrapers are not used for site grading and a dump truck is employed: the haul may be to long, the haul may cross roads where scrapers are not permitted, hard rock may be encountered, equipment availability, etc. Dump trucks are in common use and probably require little discussion. The Construction Supervisor should be aware of a difference in bed types. Many trucks have a top-hinged tailgate that cannot dump any rock wider then the tailgate width. \"Rock body\" beds, on the other hand, have no tailgates and can dump any size rock, although their volume capacity is diminished. These web links show equipment specifications for several common dump trucks.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7Compaction Equipmentincreases the density of the soil and in some cases provides a smooth, rolled surface. Compactors achieve these results by either static weights or vibration. Care must be taken when using a vibrating compactor concerning nearby structures and pumping excess water up through the soil. The vibrations can literally causes nearby buildings to fall down. The compactor surface that touches the soil can be classified as either steel drum, pneumatic rubber-tired, or sheepsfoot. Compactors can be either self-propelled or towed. These web links show equipment specifications for several common compactors.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7Hydraulic Excavatorsare extremely useful machines for both bulk excavation and trench excavation. Usually self-propelled on tracks, excavators operate hydraulically. The cable driven power shovels are the forerunner of the modern day excavator. These web links show equipment specifications for several common hydraulic excavators.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7Backhoe Loadersperform a multitude of chores on an average building project: dig trenches, load material, haul material and equipment, unload trucks, provide transport, etc. Backhoe loaders are self-propelled and rubber-tire machines. These web links show equipment specifications for several common backhoe loaders.http://www.cat.com/cda/layout?m=37840&x=7So take some time and learn the basic equipment that Sitework Contractors use. Remember, the person who calls every piece of equipment on the jobsite a \"Bulldozer\" labels himself as a dope.",
  "What You should Know about Rock Excavation?": "Rock excavation solutions vary greatly. The best method to remove rock in an excavation must be reassessed continually for changing conditions. However rock excavation is a fact of construction life and must be anticipated by the Construction Supervisor.Prior to a project beginning, an Owner has probably already considered the possibility of rock in the excavation area and the associated costs. The Owner makes a decision during the design stage about the amount of geotechnical information required. The Owner has many exploratory options available. From a simple test pit to percussion drilling to core drilling the owner has increasingly more expensive options that yield increasingly better data about the site underground.For example, the Owner on a 100,000 SF building project may authorize twenty boring locations with split spoon soil samples taken until rock is reached and then core samples of rock. This information can be carefully studied by the Construction Supervisor and Sitework Contractor and used to help make the project schedule. Knowing the type and quality of rock (from the core samples) and location of rock (from the soils boring) is a real advantage in jobsite planning.Conversely, the Owner of a 100,000 SF building may decide to proceed with no geotechnical testing whatsoever. The decision about geotechnical testing is usually made by an Owner with no input from the Construction Supervisor.All too often, though, some geotechnical testing information is available to the Construction Supervisor and is not properly utilized. The section onSoils and Geologyhelps you understand the terms in the geotechnical report.A knowledge of the approximate location of the rock helps the Construction Supervisor to plan the sequence of steps following rock excavation. If rock is in one corner of a large building project, for example, the earth excavation could begin at the opposite end of the building in order to start foundation work soonest. This simple example indicates the usefulness of rock core borings (which show the type and quality of rock encountered). Beginning the foundation work early would be a good idea if the rock could be removed by ripping. However, if the rock is extremely hard and requires substantial blasting, it may be prudent to hold foundation work until the blasting is completed. The Construction Supervisor should coordinate these types of decisions and use all the technical date available.Think about payment terms for rock on each project. Unclassified excavation stipulates that all rock or other unexpected materials (excluding hazardous materials) encountered in the sitework will be the responsibility of the Contractor at no change in contract cost. An unclassified excavation is simpler from a book-keeping standpoint and places the responsibility for geotechnical conditions onto the Sitework Contractor.Classified excavation, on the other hand, defines rock and makes provisions for measurement and payment of any rock encountered at an agreed upon unit price. This method places the rock payment responsibility onto the Owner. The Construction Supervisor must be aware if the excavation is classified or unclassified. If classified, the Construction Supervisor must help set-up clearly understood procedures for definition and measurement of rock quantities.Rock is removed by ripping, blasting, or breaking, depending on the rock type, quality and quantity. Ripping is a mechanical splitting of rock by inserting a steel point into a rock crevice and applying force. The force is usually supplied by a bulldozer. Blasting involves explosives placed in drill holes and detonated. Breaking of rock by a hydraulic hammer bit mounted on an excavator is used when the rock quantity is small or blasting is not feasible.If blasting is required for rock excavation, the Construction Supervisor should be assured that the work is performed by a licensed blaster and that the proper permits have been obtained. The effect on existing structures and nearby work should also be discussed with the blaster.",
  "How Water Affects Sitework?": "It's amazing what a heavy rain can do to a construction project. Prior to the rain, the site may be dry, heavy equipment efficiently moving earth, the other trades smoothly performing their work. Within hours the project can be a sloppy, mud-hole with worker efficiency cut to about 10%. In many cases, the change comes mostly from poor planning. In most areas of the world, the Construction Supervisor must remember a simple fact: IT WILL RAIN.Good planning can minimize the damage and disruption of a heavy rain to a jobsite. Often the excavation and grading is left to the Sitework Contractor (and their Foremen is responsible to supervise and direct the heavy equipment and operators). But remember, the Construction Supervisor is responsible to complete the entire project in an efficient, timely manner. Therefore the Construction Supervisor must be continuously aware of what rain will do to the project site. It is not uncommon for the Sitework Foreman to work their heavy equipment for maximum efficiency and hope it doesn't rain.One of the best ways to prepare for rain is to slope all grades to drain and to smooth rolled the surface prior to a rain. This work can cut down on short-term productivity, but can really help a jobsite more quickly recover from a storm. The Construction Supervisor must be far-sighted enough to insure that heavy rain does not stop work on the project longer than necessary. Daily discussions with Sitework Foremen may be required to achieve this goal.Any time excavation is required below the existing water table on a project, the process of dewatering must be considered. Generally dewatering is required because of a high level of ground water (underground streams and springs) in areas with cohesionless (sandy or gravelly) soil or water yielding rock. In a truly cohesive soil, the water travels so slowly through the clay or silt that dewatering is not usually necessary for the relatively short time of excavation.Dewatering may be required for a single footing excavation or for an entire project site. The most common dewatering methods are trench drains, deep wells and well points. A variety of pumps and piping types are used with these systems. Ground water seepage can also be decreased by cutoff methods such as sheet piling.The costs for dewatering can be staggering, including equipment rental, labor and electricity (or fuel). High dewatering costs have paled the profit margins on far too many projects. The many variables listed below make the job of estimating dewatering costs very difficult, and very inexact.Specific soil and rock characteristics and locations.Groundwater location, extent, direction and rate of movement (including seasonal variations).Most efficient dewatering method: trench drains, deep wells, wellpoints.Effectiveness of cutoff structures.Time period dewatering is required.Costs associated with dewatering system failure (mucking out and cleaning).Costs associated with over dewatering (damage to adjacent structures).In dewatering, the simplest solution is often the best. On many sites dewatering can be accomplished without pumps, using gravity, by the use of trench drains or siphons. This option should always be considered when analyzing the prospect of dewatering. Obviously the option is only viable if gravity can run the water to lower ground. Trench drains can be cut with a backhoe and filled with a coarse, granular material (#4 stone for example), but care must be exercised in choosing the water outlet type and location.Siphons present an economical, and often overlooked, method of dewatering. A siphon, by definition, uses atmospheric pressure to carry water from one elevation, up over an obstacle, to a lower elevation. The pipes in a siphon system must be airtight and some ingenuity is often required to completely fill the siphon pipe. The siphon pipe must be full for the siphon to begin. The time required for siphon dewatering is usually longer then for pumps since the force moving the water is atmospheric pressure, not electricity or gasoline.A deep well consists of a pump, hose and a vertical well casing. The pump intake is at the bottom of the well casing (usually some crushed stone is placed down there as a filter medium). The water is pumped up the hose, out of the well casing, and to a suitable discharge location. The effectiveness of a deep well depends mainly of the permeability of the soil. In a coarse sand, for example, a large area can be pumped to near the pump intake elevation. A less permeable soil, on the other hand, reduces the effectiveness of a deep well. Since the pump is generally at the bottom of the deep well, there are no height limitations due to vacuum lift, and deep wells can lower the groundwater over 50 feet.Wellpoints are the most complex dewatering system discussed here. The wellpoint system is composed of vertical wellpoints (commonly 1-\ufffd inches diameter) connected to a header pipe at grade and a vacuum/discharge pump at grade. The wellpoints operate on the principle of vacuum and have a maximum depth of about 15 feet. If deeper dewatering is required, successive sets of wellpoints can be installed at lower elevations.The vertical wellpoint is actually jetted into the ground with water. On the bottom of the wellpoint there is a 2 foot long screen and valve, water jets out of this valve and creates a hole into which the wellpoint pipe can be lowered. This hole is often made a larger diameter (for example 10 inches) to allow for a coarse sand backfill to help filter the water. The wellpoint spacing depends on the permeability of the soil, but 2 feet to 6 feet centers are common. On average a single pump can handle up to 50 wellpoints.The jetting portion of wellpoint work generally results in quite a bit of mud and muck at grade. The Construction Supervisor should assure that provisions are made for this material to be removed. While the wellpoint system usually does an excellent job of dewatering, the pipes also cause significant congestion at grade. Since the Construction Supervisor manages the project site, he should strategically place the wellpoints and headers to minimize conflicts.Pumps are the most important, and the most troublesome, piece of equipment in most dewatering schemes. Most dewatering pumps are described by the following categories:Centrifugal pumpsa.\u00a0 suction pumpsb.\u00a0 submersible pumpsDiaphragm pumps (or trash pumps)Centrifugal pumps come in a great variety of sizes, from a 1-\ufffd inch to over 12 inch nominal discharge diameter. The most common sizes are 2 inch and 3 inch nominal discharge diameter. Centrifugal pumps can be driven by gasoline or diesel engines or be electrically powered. If gas or diesel, provisions must be made to keep fuel in the tank; these solutions range from assigning the responsibility to someone to special valves that feed fuel from 55 gallon drums. Special care must be used with liquid fuel on the jobsite.Electric pumps tend to be easier to use in many ways, but safety is an important aspect here also. It is extremely disconcerting to be standing ankle deep in water, working on a pump, and realize that the guy who wired it didn't know a volt from an amp. Even though it seems trivial, get an electrician to wire dewatering pumps. Using the proper breaker, wire size and ground fault protection is essential.Centrifugal suction pumps have a rigid suction line (to prevent collapse) and lift water up the level of the pump. Fifteen to twenty feet is the maximum height that water can be lifted by suction. Some centrifugal suction pumps are self priming, but many must be primed prior to each use, which can be labor intensive and annoying.The centrifugal submersible pump operates in the bottom of the hole. There is no suction line, the pump must be flooded. With proper float controls these electric pumps can be quite trouble free.Diaphragm pumps are the workhorses of construction dewatering; pumping mud, sand, small rocks, and trash (pumped\u00a0 material can be up to 70% of the size of the pump intake). The diaphragm pump uses a rigid suction line and is generally self-priming. The responsibility for installing and maintaining construction dewatering pumps must be clearly assigned. Sometimes weeks of work can be ruined if the pumps malfunction for only one day. Therefore the Construction Supervisor should know who is responsible for dewatering and be updated of the status regularly.The use of cutoff walls can also help control ground water on a construction project site. Water seepage horizontally through the soil can be a major source of water entering a project. A below grade cutoff wall can virtually stop this horizontal flow of water. Interlocking steel sheet piling, is the most common type of cutoff wall. Sheet piling functions best in course grained soils where boulder sizes are generally less then 6 inches, or where there are stratified soil layers and horizontal water flow greatly exceeds vertical. It is important to drive cutoff walls well below the inside excavation elevation.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Excavation:": "Prior to any site work, get several blank site plans and mark them up with color markers showing major site and building staging issues: topsoil piles, fill piles, parking areas, material storage areas, layout locations, etc.Understand the disposal method and location for stumps, trees and brush prior to the start. Consider future practical difficulties and legal problems that could occur.If an offsite dump site is to be used, verify that any required permits are in place.Know demolition scope of work clearly before any work begins (people seem to have no sense of humor when you mistakenly tear their stuff down).When excavation begins do the following:a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grab a handful of topsoil or whatever organic soil there is and squeeze it and getfamiliar with the texture, color and smell. Keep looking for that soil in placeswhere it shouldn\u2019t be.b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grab a handful of soil, squeeze it and do a quick guess of a soil classification perthe instructions above. Keep looking if the soil type changes in different areasof the site.c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discuss the soil type with the excavating foreman, learn about the way the soilcompacts, passes water, etc.Get Site Contractor to agree to smooth roll and grade to drain at any time rain is expected.",
  "Why It Never Pays to Surprise the Utility \rCompany?": "It is extremely helpful at the beginning of a project for the superintendent to contact all the utility companies that willhave any involvement in the project. The superintendent should determine who is the utility contact person and what series of events the utility expects. It never pays to surprise a utility company.If the utility contact person will visit the jobsite, they can bring the technical information and standards of the utility.\u00a0 A plan can then be established and agreed upon for the start, duration, and completion of utility related work. The plan should include as much information as is known about who will do the work and what work will be cone. Make sure to put this plan in writing and send a copy to the utility contact person. A written agreement here means much more then a verbal agreement; it is simply more likely to be effective.The beginning of a project is a very busy time and the utility people don't have to be contacted the first day. Howeverthere is a distinct advantage in having them involved early in a project. Organizations don't get things done, people do.\u00a0 And to have the utility contact person feel a responsibility, or an \"ownership\" in the project will be a clear benefit.",
  "What Should I Know about Stormwater Piping?": "Most storm sewer piping flows by gravity, no pumps create pressure. The storm water drops into the system by inlets or roof drains then flows downhill. Obviously, the grade of the pipe matters. A low spot, or belly, in the pipe makes a trap, while a high spot, or hump, creates a dam. So the pipe crew needs to keep the pipe inverts (the lowest spot in the pipe where the water flows) installed in a straight line, at the slope required on the drawings.While the storm sewer piping rarely appears on thecritical pathof a project schedule, it's surprising how many times the storm sewer installation becomes becomes a problem and delays the project. Some of the common issues that occur with storm sewer piping are:Unexpected rock excavationExisting pipes in the way, discovered only during the installationDesign errors that only become apparent during the installationBecause of these type problems, the Construction Supervisor should pay special attention to the storm piping.The Construction Supervisor's goal for the pipe work should be a speedy installation that surpasses the specification requirements (i.e. leakage, line, grade, backfill, etc.). Even if the pipe work is subcontracted, it is detrimental to the project to allow unacceptable pipe work to continue. If the pipe work has to be dug-up and redone at a later date, many other trades will be adversely affected. I realize the Construction Supervisor can not be inspecting every item of work on the project. From my experience, one can predict the final quality (or acceptability) of pipe work by how the pipe foremen organizes the work. If the transit is set-up, the backhoe always digging, trenches are straight, and the pipe fitters are working methodically, the pipe work will typically be successful. On the other hand, a disorganized foreman and crew that appear to start and stop and constantly change methods are headed for trouble. I feel the Construction Supervisor should be aware how the underground pipe work progresses and should try head-off quality problems early.It's also important to have a basic understanding of the common pipe types. Most project I see these days use High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe. The are lots of variations of HDPE available, which are shown on the following site:http://www.hancor.com/product/pipe.htmlSometimes concrete pipe still comes through as the best choice, due to it's strength and durability. Some concrete pipe options are shown on the following site:http://www.shermandixie.com/products/pipe/index.phpCorrugated metal pipe (CMP) also gets used often and some CMP options are shown on the following site:http://www.contech-cpi.com/drainage/products_materials/metal/corrugated_metal_pipe/144The degree to which storm sewer pipe must be water-tight is normally made clear in the project specifications. Sometimes, a bit of water leakage from storm sewer piping is acceptable (often a trade off for lower cost and easier installation) and other times the storm sewer piping must be water-tight under a low pressure.I remember working as a foreman for a Sitework Contractor building a large horse training track. The CMP we installed under the actual track was leaking, causing a slight settlement in the track. Since inside connecting bands can be used to repair leaking existing CMP lines, we were told to get those pipes water-tight. Repairs with these inside connecting bands can only be used in large enough diameter pipe for workers to crawl through and work in. These leaks were about 80' in from the outlet and the pipe was 18\" CMP. Since my Dad always told me never to have someone do a job I wouldn't do myself, two of us started to shimmy into that pipe with the inside repair bands. I ventured about one pipe section into the pipe and immediately started crawling back for daylight with a vengeance! I still remember that intense, panicked feeling. The two guys I then sent into the pipe made the repair with no problems and I learned an exception in a leadership rule.",
  "What Should I Know about Sanitary Sewer Piping?": "Sanitary sewers require minimum exfiltration (sewage leaking out of the system and into the ground) and infiltration (groundwater leaking into the system). The main elements are pipe, manholes and clean-outs. The purpose of sanitary manholes is to allow inspection and cleaning of sewers and to remove obstruction. The minimum manhole diameter is typically four feet with 21\" frame opening for access. Manholes are constructed of brick, block, poured-in-place concrete or precast concrete. Special care must be taken to limit sub-grade settlement to avoid cracking the adjacent pipes. Solid, rather than grated, covers are used on sanitary manholes to control odors. Ladder rungs must be securely anchored into the manhole walls and care taken that the steps will not pull out (fail) in several years. Failure of a manhole ladder rung is a serious, and all too common, liability and it's avoidable. Clean-outs are used on smaller pipe and allow a location to insert cleaning tools to flush the pipe.The most common pipe used in sanitary sewer systems is PVC sewer pipe SDR-35, a typical manufacturer's website is:http://www.dpcpipe.com/pdfs/SewerPipeSpecSheet.pdfSometimes concrete pipe still comes through as the best choice, due to it's strength and durability. Some concrete pipe options are shown on the following site:http://www.shermandixie.com/products/pipe/index.phpMost sanitary sewer lines flow by gravity, which probably is the origin of the saying that shit flows downhill. The following US Dept of Defense guide for designing gravity sewer piping helps you understand how to size pipes for different flows and slope conditions. I apologize for the lack of clarity for the Manning Formula Nomograph Chart (the detail needs print quality not web monitor quality), but you can go to theWastewater Collection Manualand print out a clear version.An on-lot septic tank takes sanitary waste, allows the solids to settle to the bottom and decompose organically, keeps the scum on the top from flowing out of the tank. It yields a fluid from the outlet that has greatly reduced suspended solids and can flow into a leaching field (for further organic breakdown with soil contact) without clogging the drain field system. The figure below illustrates a typical septic tank design.Septic Tank",
  "What Should I Know about Water Piping?": "Water piping systems use pressure (conveying water at a pressure above atmospheric) to allow the fluid to flow for long runs and uphill. Pressure systems use pumps to create that pressure.For example, a public water supply system may have a pump at elevation 100.00 that pumps to an 80 psi pressure. Assume the piping system will lose 1 psi pressure for every 3000 feet of pipe. A house that is 6000 feet from the pump and at elevation 90.00 will lose 2 psi from gravity losses and gain 5 psi from elevation change (pressure changes about 1/2 psi for every one foot of elevation change), so the water pressure at that house is 83 psi. Another house 18,000 feet from the pump at an elevation of 140.00 will lose 6 psi from friction losses and 20 psi from elevation change. The water pressure at that house will be 54 psi. This example illustrate the effect of friction losses and elevation changes on pressure piping. For some more background, go to theBasic Fluidspage. Gravity piping, of course, can never have fluids run uphill.Typical water installations from a public utility require a tap into the utility main pipe, a meter, and some type of backflow prevention. I won't go into many specifics here, since the components vary so dramatically depending on the amount of water needed and the utility's standards. In general, though, you should know that water meters can cause a significant pressure drop and that drop needs to be included in the determination that adequate water pressure will be provided.I was working on a nursing home addition in which we were adding fire protection sprinklers. The Municipal Engineer drew plans providing us with public water. Only as the Superintendent probed, though, did we find that the water line that was shown would have almost no water pressure or\u00a0 volume. We couldn't even add a pump in that situation, because we would have sucked the line dry. Fortunately, the Superintendent made this discovery right before we planned to demolish an underground cistern, which we ended up using as a water storage tank to make the system work. The moral of the story is that a Construction Supervisor can add huge value to a Project by paying attention and understanding/verifying basic assumptions.The types of pipe used for water lines varies greatly, depending on size and cost issues. For smaller installations, copper piping still gets lots of use. Although copper piping should not be used with water with a Ph less than 6.8 because the acidity of the water deteriorates the copper. Note that acidity in water is not the same measure as hardness. Even though water with a high Ph is often hard water, water with a low Ph can also be hard, since the hardness stems from calcium and magnesium levels, not the Ph level. The various sizes of copper tube (measured to the outside diameter) and copper pipe (measured to the inside diameter) are shown athttp://www.sizes.com/materls/pipeCopper.htmSome plastic pipe information is found at the following link:http://www.plumbingstore.com/info-pipesizes.html",
  "What Should I Know about Electric, Gas and Communications?": "GASThe primary uses of gas include heating, cooling (rarely used), and powering engines for electric generators. Gas pressures rangefrom 20 psi to 50 psi in most utility distribution systems. When the gas enters the service connection, the pressure is typically reduced by a regulator to approximately l/4 to 1/2 psi. Since gas is a vapor it has a tendency to rise; this fact explains how such a low pressure can be used for distribution throughout a building.\u00a0 Black steel pipe, coated to reduce corrosion, is the mostcommonly used gas distribution piping inside a building.ELECTRICAL/TELEPHONE/CABLE TVThe method of installation of underground electric, telephone, and cable TV are often very similar. All threeutilities have utilized both of the following installation methods:Direct burial cableUnderground conduit (cable pulled through later)In either case the trench depth will be dictated by the local utility as will the cable size and type. Direct burial cable isusually a simple and economic installation. There are some strong advantages, though, to underground conduit. Firstly additional cable can be pulled at a later date by installing a spare conduit. Secondly the conduit provides some protection from cable damage due to accidental excavation. Thirdly, some cable has a long delivery lead time and conduit installation allows the remainder of the sitework to progress.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for \rUtilities and Piping:": "It never pays to surprise a Utility Company.",
  "What are the Basics of Retaining Walls?": "Retaining walls are used to make a transition in finish grade elevations; the wall keeps soil at a higher elevation behind it. In order to accomplish this task, there are some rather tricky considerations concerning the soil behavior and wall structure. The figure below shows the typical details of three common types: cantilever retaining wall, gravity retaining wall, and basement (propped cantilever) retaining wall. Concrete retaining walls will be discussed here, masonry, or even aluminum, retaining walls are sometimes used and most of the principles will be applicable for these types of walls also.As in many areas of construction, understanding the way an item fails helps to make the design assumptions and details more clear. The retained soil experts a pressure, or load, against a retaining wall. This load can cause the wall to fail in typically one of three ways. The first method of failure is overturning. The details in the previous figure show a dashed line where the soil fails due to overturning. Basically the wall remains structurally intact, but rotates forward about its toe and lifts the soil above its heel. The second method of failure is sliding. Again the wall stays structurally intact but slides horizontally forward due to the pressure of the retained soil. The third method of failure is structural wall failure and is similar to any other reinforce concrete failure.The method of determining exactly how much pressure a soil will exert on a retaining wall is very complicated. In fact engineers have studied the problem for centuries and revised solutions are continually being proposed and discussed. A good starting point for discussing pressure on a retaining wall is to consider the retained material to be water. The pressure against the wall, then, is determined by the material density (62.4 pounds per cubic foot) and the wall height. For example, a 10' wall retaining water would have the following pressures against the wall.1' down from top of wall=1' x 62.4\u00a0 lb/cf\u00a0 = 62.4 lb/sf5' down from top of wall=5' x 62.4 lb/cf\u00a0 = 312 lb/sf10' down from top of wall=10' x 62.4 lb/cf\u00a0 = 624 lb/sfRetained soil does not generally act like a fluid. The horizontal pressure in soil is less then the vertical pressure and is described by \"K\"- the coefficient of lateral earth pressure. The 10' wall example now retains soil with a density of 105 PCF and a K factor of .3; with the following results:Vertical:1' down from top of wall=1' x l05 lb/cf\u00a0 = 105 lb/sf5' down from top of wall=5' x 105 lb/cf\u00a0 = 525 lb/sf10' down from top of wall=10' x 105 lb/cf\u00a0 = 1050 lb/sfHorizontal: (against wall)1' down from top of wall=1'x 105 lb/cf\u00a0 x 3 = 35 lb/sf5' down from top of wall=5 x 105 lb/cf\u00a0 x 3 = 175 lb/sf10' down from top of wall=10 x 105 lb/cf\u00a0 x3 = 350lb/sfThe real significance for the Construction Supervisor of studying lateral pressure on retaining walls is in the following step. The lateral earth pressure K is subdivided in Ka (active), Ko (at rest) and Kp (passive). The active state occurs if the wall can move slightly (this usually occurs by the wall rotating a minute amount). The at rest state occurs if the wall is absolutely rigid and can not move (as in the case of a basement wall). Finally the passive state occurs when a structure pushes against, or into, soil (as in the base of a retaining wall pushing against soil to resist sliding).A simplified example of design of a retaining wall may be helpful here to illustrate the above principles. If the 10' retaining wall retains soils with a density of 105 lb/cf, Ka = 0.3, K.= 0.5 and Kp = 3.0 the following conclusions can be drawn:If the wall can rotate slightly, the pressure 10' down from the top of the wall = 10' x 105lb/cf\u00a0\u00a0 x 0.3 = 350 lb/sfIf the wall is supported at the top (basement wall), the pressure 10' down from the top of the wall = 10' x 105lb/cf\u00a0 x 0.5 = 525 lb/sfPart of the resistance to sliding consists of the passive soil pressure from the toe to the finish grade (say 3')=3' x 105lb/cf\u00a0 x 3.0 = 630 lb/sfFar too many retaining walls fail because the above principles are not clearly understood. Rarely does the Design Professional design for the worst case that may be encountered in the field. Regardless of the contractual arrangements it is important that the Construction Supervisor advise the Design Professional of any safety concerns regarding the retaining wall. A Construction Supervisor that understands the concepts above should check with the Design Professional in instances like the following:The retaining wall base is on solid rock. Therefore the retaining wall will not be able to rotate at all and the active lateral pressure is invalid and the higher at rest lateral pressure must be used.The water table in the area is higher then anticipated.During excavation in the area, a soft clay seam is discovered several feet under the retaining wall base. This soft clay seam could allow sliding to occur and should be checked.The only readily available material to backfill the retaining wall is clay.No drainage or weephole information is given on the design drawing.CANTILEVER:Reinforced concrete cantilever retaining walls are commonly used because of their efficient use of materials. However, since it is an efficient design, it is critical that design details be followed explicitly. The base is used to translate the lateral soil load to a downward load on the toe and an upward load of the heel. Therefore there is a couple (or a moment) in the base that is resisted by the top and bottom rebar. The rebar in the base that runs parallel to the wall is for temperature and shrinkage resistance. The vertical rebar in the stem (nearest the retained soil) carries the tension load down into the base. This is the main structural rebar in the wall. The horizontal and front face vertical rebar is for temperature and shrinkage resistance.Cantilever retaining walls are generally designed with gravel backfill immediately behind the wall and a drainage and weephole system. These drainage systems allow the wall to be designed for a much lower soil pressure, and if the drainage is not properly installed the wall may fail.GRAVITY:A reinforced concrete, or plain concrete, gravity retaining wall is designed on the same soil principles as acantilever retaining wall. However the resistance to overturning is based on the bulk weight of the concrete. The formwork, rebar and pour sequencing is significantly simpler with a gravity retaining wall. Often the only rebar required is for temperature and shrinkage at the face and top.BASEMENT WALLS:A reinforced concrete basement retaining wall is structurally quite different from a cantilever retaining wall.The main difference is based on the simply supported beam versus a cantilever. In a basement wall the main tension rebar is on the inside wall face while in a cantilever wall the main tension rebar is on the outside (or retained earth) face. In a basement wall the base footing does not transmit a moment to the soil, but only resists sliding. A basement wall can be detailed as shown in the previous figure or can be supported various other ways at the top of the wall. For example a cable imbedded in the top of the wall and tied back to a concrete deadman in the soil creates a basement wall condition.It is essential for the Construction Supervisor to differential between cantilever retaining walls and basement retaining walls during construction. Basement walls must be supported at the top prior to backfilling, which can be very difficult in some instances. It is regretfully common to see Design Professionals make retaining wall details that are structurally sound upon completion but extremely difficult to build. The Construction Supervisor must recognize these situations, understand the various factors as well as possible, and proceed as a team member to help resolve the problem.",
  "What to Know about Driving Piles?": "The two basic classifications for piles are bearing piles and sheet piles. Bearing piles are used like columns to transmit foundation loads downward to rock or deeper soils. Sheet pilings are used as bulkheads to retain soil or water. Piles are driven vertically into the ground by power hammers or vibrators to a certain amount of resistance or load determined by the Geotechnical Engineer. This information is usually given in blows per inch for the hammer being used.The allowable piling load is usually not determined by the structural capacity of the pile, but by the piles' ability to transfer its load to the soil. This load is transferred in the following three ways:End-bearing-all the load is transmitted from the bottom tip of the pile to the rock below.Friction-all the load is transmitted by friction between the surface of the entire length of the pile and the adjacent soil.Combination of the aboveThere are historically many variations of types and materials used as piles. Wood was the pile material first used and is still in common use due to economy and workability. The main drawbacks to wood are in the areas of durability and heavy load capacity. Precast concrete piles can carry heavy loads but are bulky to handle with a tendency towards cracking. Precast, pre-stressed piles help eliminate many of the cracking problems. There is a wide variety of proprietary cast in place concrete piles. If these piles are used on a project, the Construction Supervisor should try to obtain and review the manufacturer's literature. Steel H piles are made of rolled steel H sections and are often used due to their combination of high strength and relative economy. Steel pipe piles are often somewhat higher in cost but have the advantage of a uniform section in any direction and the full length of the interior can be inspected after driving. Composite piles, finally, are a combination of one material for the lower part and another material for the upper part of the pile.Sheet piles are defined as piles driven very closely together that interlock, thus forming a continuous wall or sheet. Wood, concrete, or steel are the most common materials for sheet piling.Some common uses for sheet piling include:Permanent bulkhead to retain fillPermanent deep enclosure at base of waterfront structure to prevent erosion or scour.Permanent forms for cofferdams, retaining walls, piers, etc.Temporary construction wall to retain earth at excavationsWhen working with sheet piling it is important to consider both the method of driving and the method of removal before the work begins. Plan the type of machine to use and its working location. A good Piling Contractor will know many \"tricks\" for effectively using the different types of piles. Conversations and planning with the Piling Contractor prior to work can be extremely helpful.One of the four common uses for sheet piles listed above is the temporary construction wall to retain earth at excavations. Often the Contractor has responsibility to design, install, maintain and remove these sheet piles. There are some simple, but important considerations when deciding what method of sheet piling to use. The first decision must be whether the sheeting wall must retain water. Steel interlock sheet piling is designed to retain water as will the various wood interlock systems shown. The concrete interlock sheet piling is generally less effective at retaining water since it lacks the positive interlock of steel and the swelling characteristics of wood.Wood sheeting without interlocks or soldier piles (vertical driven steel H-piles with horizontal timber sheeting) do not retain water.The use and location of the excavation will dictate if water must be retained by the sheet piling. The Construction Supervisor must understand if the sheet piling wall actually will retain water or let water pass through the sheeting. The load resisted by the sheet piling is 2 to 4 times larger if water is retained. Many failures result from not taking this simple fact into consideration. The next important consideration is whether to cantilever or simply support the sheet pile wall. A cantilever sheet piling has no horizontal bracing and transfers the retaining wall load to the soil at the sheet piling toe. It is important to know that the pieces of vertical sheeting have the structural capacity to carry that load and that the soil at the sheeting toe can also resist the load. The soil at the sheeting toe resists the load as a structural couple, so increasing the amount of sheeting imbedment in the soil significantly increases the load capability. A simply supported sheet piling wall has horizontal whalers supporting the sheeting. The soil at toe of the sheeting then resists horizontal load only and no moment. The whalers must be appropriately designed and supported at the ends for the retaining wall load.",
  "What to Know about Drilling Caissons?": "Caissons, likes piles, are a deep foundation type that are most often used when shallow, spread footings are not feasible. The first distinction of caisson types is pneumatic or open air. Pneumatic caissons (or compressed air caissons) have air tight sides and top and are open on the bottom only. Usually a double air lock door is used at the top of the caisson and the caisson is pressurized.Open caissons can also be broken down into two types: sheet pile box and drilled pier. The sheet pile box caisson is formed using conventional excavation equipment and some type of sheet piling (see above discussion of sheet piling). There are several different sequences for excavating and driving sheet piles that yield an acceptable sheet pile box caisson. The specific circumstances will dictate the sequence of work for the Construction Supervisor. Some projects require the caisson sheeting to be removed while other projects require the sheeting to remain. This question must generally be approved by the Design Professional or Owner.Drilled pier caissons diameters are generally chosen by the design professional by determining the load from the superstructure and distributing that load to the rock beneath the caisson. For example a building column may have a load of 100 tons and the allowable rock bearing of 20 tons per square foot.100 tons / 20 tons/sf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 sf of rock bearing requiredSince a 3' diameter circle has an area of about 7 sf, a 36\" caisson would be selected.There is a method of increasing the rock bearing area without making a larger diameter caisson. It's called a bell caisson. A bell is formed by a special auger that increases the diameter caisson immediately above the rock bearing surface therefore the 100 ton load used in the example above could be carried by a 24 inch diameter caisson with a 36\" bell. Bells can not be used if the soil immediately above rock is not suitable to be undercut.Another method of increasing load in drilled pier caissons uses a rock socket. If a caisson is drilled several feet in solid rock, the load from the superstructure can be transferred to both the rock below the caisson and the sides of the rock (rock) socket.Another important consideration with drilled pier caissons is verification of a solid, level bearing rock surface. Generally caissons 30 inches diameter or larger can be temporarily protected with steel casing and inspected. If the rock surface is sloping steeply, the inspector may require that the bottom be jack-hammered to a more level surface. The inspector can also check the quality of the rock at bearing. Finally, in sinkhole prone areas, a small diameter (2\" - 3\") hole may be drilled several feet below the bearing area to insure solid rock and no voids.Payment for drilled pier caissons can vary from totally unclassified to unit price for rock or earth drilling. The method of payment should be clearly understood by the Construction Supervisor and a mutually acceptable record-keeping system should be instituted from the beginning of the project.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Sitework \rStructures and Deep Foundations:": "To avoid retaining wall failures, make sure the water drainage system at the retaining wall actually works as designed.When backfilling retaining walls, understand if they are designed as cantilevers or basement walls.Understand any extra payment terms for deep foundations prior to the start of work.",
  "What Should I Know About Curb?": "Curb runs storm water where you want it and keeps idiot drivers off the grass. So the local codes or the Civil Engineer will probably dictate if curb needs to be installed for the stormwater part. Often the Owner chooses whether to invest in curb to keep the cars off the grass or landscaping, making a decision about future maintenance costs and the look of the project.Curbing options include 18\" concrete vertical curb, concrete rolled curb, granite curb, bituminous concrete curb and quite a few other types. In the geographic area you work, there is probably a normal curb style and standard details for installation. The Construction Supervisor should verify that the type of curb and installation details are clear to all involved parties.The schedule of the curb work should greatly interest the Construction Supervisor. Sometimes it's best to get the curb in early (and try to protect it from damage) and sometimes it's better to wait (risking bad weather and chaos at the project completion). So you should think about the curb scheduling on each project and make a determination on when to install.Curbs shout quality...or lack there of, when a visitor comes to a new building. So you should pay attention to the line, grade and overall quality of the curb. As in many areas, the Construction Supervisor can not check every detail of a subcontractor's work. I think, however, the Construction Supervisor should visually review the quality (line and grade and finish) every day for the first few days of curb work. A level of approved quality can be set for the project in this manner. It is better for all involved parties for unacceptable work to be removed immediately and replaced, rather then debating the issue for days while backfill and stone sub-grade may be placed. Telling someone to replace a section of curb because there is a visually obvious dip is not an enjoyable task. The Construction Supervisor, though, must always be responsible for cost, schedule and performance; poor quality is inadequate performance. If the construction industry is to improve itself, the Construction Supervisor can not leave the guarding of quality to an Inspector.",
  "What are the Basics of Bituminous Paving?": "Bituminous concrete is a mixture of asphalt cement and well-graded aggregate, compacted when hot into a densemass. On very small jobs bituminous concrete can be placed by hand and compacted. Typically, though, a self propelled paving machine places the mix, controlling paving depth, width and surface. Paving machines can be rubber tire or track, the rubber tire machines have a tendency to spin tires in soft sub-base and sometimes get stuck. The hot mix is delivered to the project in covered dump trucks. Some paving machines have the hot mix dumped directly into a hopper, which is then augured back to the screen for placement. Other paving machines pick-up bituminous concrete dumped onto the sub-base like a self-loading scraper. The hopper paving machines are more common than the self loading paving machines.The Paving Contractor must determine the paving widths and joint locations. This decision will be based on available equipment and manpower and must include any specific requirements from the contract specifications. The paving width and joint locations should be approved by the Inspector or Design Professional. The Construction Supervisor should be confident the Paving Foremen and crew can produce quality work and are prepared for problem conditions. It is appropriate for the Construction Supervisor to question the Paving Foreman about his plans for rainstorms, equipment breakdown, etc. The Paving Foreman should have well thorough responses to these queries.I've learned that the secret to bituminous paving longevity: make sure the sub-grade drains. If that sub-grade holds water, the freeze-thaw cycle or just the water making the soil mushy and weak will end up destroying the paving. Before stone gets placed over the sub-grade, a grader should really smooth the sub-grade and it should be smooth rolled as well. Sub-grading with a track loader will leave soil indentations that will hold pockets of water and destroy the paving.",
  "What are the Basics of Concrete Paving?": "Concrete paving is known as a rigid pavement while bituminous paving is considered flexible paving. The structural value of concrete paving is far superior to bituminous paving. The decision about which type paving to us is made by the Owner or Design Professional.\u00a0 Concrete paving machines are sometimes used on large projects and they function similar to asphalt paving machines. It is more common to see concrete pavement formed on both edges, delivered in ready-mix trucks, and final placed with a vibrating screed. The concrete mix design, type of finish, method of moisture retainage, reinforcing, and type of joints must be show in the contract documents.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Curbs and \rPaving:": "Plan the time of curb installation carefully for each project.Visually check the line, grade and finish of the first days of curb work (set a standard of acceptable quality at the onset).The secret to long lasting bituminous paving is a smooth sub-grade that drains.",
  "What Should I Know about Landscaping, Seeding and Mulching?": "Landscaping is a finishing touch on a project. It's amazing how a well designed landscape plan can transform a dull building into an exciting piece of property. The landscape plan, provided by a Landscape Architect, should show the details for the work to be performed. If the work proceeding the landscape work (i.e. excavation and embankment, layout, final grading, topsoiling) was done correctly, the landscaping should go smoothly. In this situation, the amount of input, and attention, required by the Construction Supervisor is minimal at the landscaping stage. Do the planning work at the beginning and the finishes go well.One landscaping item that must be planned in the earliest stages of a project is the topsoil. How it is stripped and where it is stored are important questions, as it's the first item in a pile and the last to be spread. You will live with that pile for the whole project, so be sure to approve its location.I once had an old equipment operator show me a trick with topsoil that proved very useful. Our topsoil stripping produced a pile of mucky, organic topsoil that would not cover half of the required area when replaced. In times when he wasn't real busy this fellow would take his track loader and mix a bucket of sandy soil and a bucket of clay soil with this topsoil. As our topsoil pile grew, the quality of the topsoil improved also. By understanding the requirements for topsoil and making use of otherwise lost time, that operator saved the earthwork contractor a significant amount of money and provided totally acceptable topsoil. There are plenty of people with creative solutions that only need to be heard.The preparation of the seed bed for planting lawns is normally covered in the Specifications. Typically a minimal topsoil depth is given along with instructions on disking and smoothing. Lime and fertilizer complete the seedbed preparation. The seeding itself can be hand spread with a seeder, mixed with water and hydro-seeded, or drilled into the soil with farm equipment. The Landscape Contractor will determine which of these methods are appropriate for the project. Mulching should follow immediately after seeding. Mulch protects the bare topsoil from erosion, conserves water and controls temperature prior to the seed growth. Chopped straw is a common mulch that can be mechanically dented into the soil with farm equipment or tacked with a spayed asphalt to avoid blowing. Fiber mulch can also be used with a hydro-seeding machine.Sodding may be required on a project to give the grounds a finished appearance or to reduce erosion. The primary rule of sodding involves placing the brown side down and the green side up. If the sod doesn't have a green side, there's a problem. Sod is easily harmed by a lack of water both before and after installation. The Construction Supervisor should be sure that the responsibility for watering is clear, as the party that waters should also be responsible to replace dead sod. The tasks of mowing, weeding and spraying should also be clearly delineated.The planting of shrubs and trees is often the last landscape work. The landscape contractor must arrange delivery and temporarily store and protect the plants. The Design Professional also specifies the allowable planting season. The Construction Supervisor should consider these dates in project scheduling. .",

  "How Does Concrete Work?": "Modern concrete consists primarily of four components: Portland cement,         sand, gravel and water. A common misconception with concrete is that it         dries and gets hard. Actually, the hydraulic cement reacts with the         water in a chemical process called hydration. As an example, concrete         can be placed underwater and will still change from a liquid state to a         solid state and achieve full strength.Many additional ingredients can be added to the basic concrete mix in         order to change the properties of the resulting concrete. The following         list shows some common admixtures (additives) and additional ingredients         and their basic purposes:AdmixturesAccelerators speed up the hydration, or hardening, of           the wet concrete. Often used in colder temperatures so the concrete           crew has less waiting time between placing and finishing the concrete.Retarders slow the hydration, or hardening, of the wet concrete.           Often used in hotter temperatures so the concrete doesn\u2019t set too           quickly, allowing the concrete finishing crew to get the proper           finishing work completed.Air entraining agents add and help distribute tiny air bubbles           throughout the concrete. These tiny air bubbles help the concrete           resist the freeze-thaw cycles with much less cracking and damage.Plasticizers and Superplasticizers improve the workability of the           concrete during the wet (or plastic) stage allowing the concrete to           flow more easily. They are particularly helpful when placing concrete           around congested rebar arrangements. Alternatively, Plasticizers and           Superplasticizers can be used to lower the water content in the           concrete while keeping a decent level of workability.Pigments change the color of the concrete for aesthetic reasons.AdditionsFly Ash can replace about half of the required amount of Portland           cement. Fly Ash is a by product of coal fired electric generating           plants, so is often readily available and economical. Concrete made           with Fly Ash and Portland cement can have higher strength and improved           chemical resistance and durability. The use of Fly Ash concrete is           considered environmentally sound, since most fly ash otherwise ends up           in landfills and the energy to produce the replaced Portland cement           can also be saved.Ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS or GGBFS) can also           replace part of the required Portland cement. GGBS is a by product of           the steel production process. GGBS has had the most use in Europe and           Asia.Silica Fume can also replace part of the required Portland cement.           Silica Fume is a by product of the manufacture of silica alloys. The           particle size of Silica Fume is 100 times smaller than that of           Portland cement. Silica Fume improves concrete strength, abrasion           resistance and corrosion resistance to chemicals, particularly to           salts.",
  "What are the Structural Basics for Concrete?": "Concrete is strong in compression. So what does that really mean?To understand compressive strength, think about several packs of         crackers sitting on the floor. If you carefully stand on those packs of         crackers, your weight will probably be supported, but you are putting         those crackers in compression. Your weight tends towards crushing those         crackers. If you jump up and land on those packs of crackers, you will         increase the force applied and probably crush the crackers. You will         have made the crackers fail in compression.Now try to jump on a concrete sidewalk. You\u2019d have to jump pretty         high to make that sidewalk crush under your weight. In fact, you         probably couldn\u2019t make that sidewalk fail in compression. That\u2019s why         concrete gets used so much in construction. But the story doesn\u2019t end         with compression.Grab a piece of string and pull in either direction. You\u2019ve just put         the string into tension. If you can pull hard enough, the string will         fail in tension by snapping. Concrete, while quite strong in         compression, fails quickly in tension by cracking. The resistive         strength of concrete for compression is around 4,000 pounds per square         inch, while the resistive strength for concrete in tension is probably         less than 400 pounds per square inch. Generally, the tension strength of         concrete is less than 10% of its compression strength.Builders in the past understood these properties of concrete and         stone and typically used those materials only in compression. So walls         could be concrete and stone, as could foundations, since both primarily         resisted downward compression loads.Arches are an interesting structural form because arches also act totally in compression. Therefore, arches above windows in old buildings could be concrete or stone because the load transferred around the arch keeping the structure in compression, so tension cracks didn\u2019t occur in the concrete or stone. Barrel vault ceilings are really just three dimensional arches, so they also worked as compression members only.If an arch above a window got too flat, however, it would stop         working as an arch and the bottom of the member would go into tension. So, regular concrete cracks at the bottom of the         beam, near the center, in this scenario. The cracking then causes the         beam to fail. This example illustrates how concrete fails in tension,         which had traditionally been a major design shortcoming for concrete.When considering the engineering use of materials, a more detailed understanding ofBasic Structural Analysishelps.",
  "What is Reinforced Concrete?": "In the mid-1800s, builders began adding steel in the concrete to carry         the tension forces. This reinforced concrete became a phenomenally         popular building method. There are several reasons why the combination         of reinforcing steel and concrete works so well:The coefficient of thermal expansion is similar for concrete and           steel, so when reinforced concretes freezes or gets hot, the two           materials contract and expand similarly. If they didn\u2019t, the           combination would tear itself apart over time.The bond between reinforcing steel bars (rebar) and concrete is           strong and efficient. The rebar has surface deformations (ridges) to           further improve that bond. Due to the strong bond, the concrete           effectively transfers stresses to the steel and vice versa.When the cement paste contacts the steel rebar, it forms a           non-reactive surface film that inhibits corrosion. This passivation           process helps rebar from corroding inside the reinforced concrete.The location of the rebar in the structure depends on the use.           Simple beams and slabs often only have rebar only on the tension           (bottom) side. When a continuous beam spans over top of columns, the           tension is at the top of the beam, so rebar is needed at the top of           the beam over column supports.Column footings are interesting to consider. Many people don\u2019t know         where the tension side exists on the footing. As a simple way to         remember, hold out your left hand with the palm facing up. Now take the         index finger of your right hand and poke down into the middle of the         outstretched palm. Cup your left hand a bit, as if reacting to the         downward force of your index finger. Insert photo here. It\u2019s easy to see         that the skin at the bottom of your left hand becomes taut (goes into         tension) and the skin on top of your hand gets wrinkly (goes into         compression).\u00a0 Therefore, the bottom of a simple concrete footing is in         tension right under the column. So the rebar needs to be near the bottom         of the footing.It is important that the reinforcing steel have enough concrete cover         so that the concrete bonds to the rebars and allows the concrete and         steel to act together as a monolithic structural unit. The concrete         cover also protects the reinforcing steel from excessive moisture or         chemical corrosion. The American Concrete Institute Building Code         recommends the following.Rebar Rules for Distance to Edge of ConcreteMinimumConcrete CoverConcrete cast against and permanently exposed to earth3\"Formed concrete exposed to earth or weather: #5 bar and smaller1 1/2\"Formed concrete exposed to earth or weather: #6 through #18 bars2\"Formed concrete not exposed to earth or weather: slabs, walls, joists: #14 & #18 bars1 1/2\"Formed concrete not exposed to earth or weather: slabs, walls, joists: #11 and smaller bars3/4\"Formed concrete not exposed to earth or weather: beams and columns:1 1/2\"A simple overview of reinforced concrete design may be helpful here.         Concrete is a material high in compression strength and low in tensile         strength. Steel, as a material, outperforms concrete 10:1 in compression         strength and 100:1 in tension strength. However, steel costs about 50         cents per pound while concrete costs about 2 cents per pound. Thus         economical reinforced concrete design uses steel to carry the tension         stresses in a structural member and concrete to carry the compression         stresses.Reinforced concrete must be designed with quite a bit of         attention paid to Expansion and Contraction. Of course, all building         materials have some degree of expansion and contraction, but with         reinforced concrete, those forces can literally break the concrete         apart.Two additional properties of reinforced concrete design that are         helpful for the Construction Supervisor to be aware of are Creep and Fatigue.         Again, all structural elements must deal with creep and fatigue, but         concrete can be quite severely changed by those phenomena.",
  "What Should I Know About Rebar?": "The amount of rebar used in typical structures is a small percentage of         the amount of concrete. Most beams, for example, use about 1% rebar for         carrying the tension forces in bending. Columns may use up to 6% rebar,         partly because the rebar carries both tension and axial forces. Since         rebar costs much more than concrete, efficient engineering design         minimizes rebar use.Rebar is central to reinforced concrete, so a basic understanding         helps. The various sizes are important to know: a #3 bar is 3/8\u201d in         diameter, a #7 bar is 7/8\u201d in diameter, etc. The easy rule of thumb for         rebar sizes is to take the rebar size and divide by 8 for the diameter         in inches.RebarDiameterWeight/ft#22/8\"or 0.25\"0.167 lbs#33/8\" or 0.375\"0.376#44/8\" or 0.5\"0.668#55/8\" or 0.625\"1.043#66/8\" or 0.75\"1.502#77/8\" or 0.875\"2.044#88/8\" or 1.0\"2.67#99/8\" or 1.125\"3.4#1010/8\" or 1.25\"4.303#1111/8\" or 1.375\"5.313#1414/8\" or 1.75\"7.65#1818/8\" or 2.25\"13.6As noted above, the structural element needs rebar to carry the         tension in the reinforced concrete. So a footing needs rebar on the         bottom, a simple beam or slab needs rebar on the bottom, etc. Rebar is         also commonly used to help control concrete shrinkage. As concrete cures         over time, it continues to shrink. Most of the shrinkage happens in the         first few hours, then less shrinkage in the first few days. The         shrinkage continues forever, but the amount of change becomes smaller         and smaller.In addition to the shrinkage due to curing, concrete will both expand         or contract as a reaction to temperature changes (as do all materials,         to some extent). Therefore, additional rebar is often used in a         structural element and is called \u201cTemperature Steel\u201d. This rebar helps         control concrete cracking due to shrinkage cracks from curing or from         temperature changes.It\u2019s common to see #4s at 12\u201d on center, #3s at 12\u201d         on center or even #3s at 18\u201d on center as temperature steel. A Construction Supervisor should be able to look at the drawings for the reinforced         concrete members and have an understanding of which rebar is structural         and which is temperature steel.Many times field decisions are made regarding pipes and ducts passing         through structural elements, which interfere with the stipulated amount         of rebar. Though these decisions should ideally be made by the         Structural Engineer, the Construction Supervisor needs to understand enough of         the structure to know when to ask. The simple precept, \u201cWhen in doubt,         always ask the Structural Engineer\u201d is easy to say but not particularly         practical when a Construction Supervisor makes hundreds of decisions a day. The         wise Construction Supervisor understands the whys and hows of rebar use.In order for reinforcing bars to be in the required location in         reinforced concrete, the bars must often be fabricated to special         shapes. Typically a steel detailer draws a Shop Drawing that takes the         schematic information from the structural drawing and shows the actual         bar lengths, bends, clearances, etc. to actually fabricate and install         the bars. These Shop Drawings should be carefully reviewed by the         Construction Supervisor to check for fit, conflicts and errors.As soon as one begins reviewing reinforcing steel shop drawings,         questions with imbedment and bar splice will arise. Reinforced concrete         structures are usually cast in individual segments but the entire         structure must act as a single unit. Construction joints create a         location to stop the concrete pour, but often it is essential for the         stresses in the reinforcing steel to carry through the construction         joint. In this case the reinforcing bars continue through the         construction joint and spice with bars on the other side. Using too long         a splice in uneconomical, because steel costs much more than concrete.         Minimum bar splices should be described in the structural drawings and         actual splices shown in the reinforcing steel shop drawings.In the recent past it was common for structural drawings to state a         40 diameter bar lap for all splices. Experience showed that simple         solution to be overly conservative in some case and to cause failure in         other cases. Therefore, a significantly more complicated set of rules         were adapted for bar splicing. It is important for the Construction Supervisor to         at least understand the terminology of the American Concrete Institute (ACI)         rules for rebar splicing.Another helpful fact for rebar concerns the markings required to be on         each bar. The Construction Supervisor should understand the markings, thus able         to pick up a piece of rebar and know its producing mill, bar size and         type and grade of steel. The figure below shows where those markings are         found on rebar.",
  "Why is the Amount of Water so Important for Concrete?": "An important item to understand in concrete work is the water-cement         ratio. A minimum amount of water, approximately 25% of the weight of the         cement, must be included to chemically hydrate the concrete batch. In         the actual mixing process, though, it takes about 35% to 40% water to         work through the mixing process, get to the actual cement, and cause         effective hydration.In practice, though, much more water gets added to increase the         workability of the concrete. So why does it matter if there is lots of         water in the concrete mix? Any water above the theoretical ideal of 25%         doesn\u2019t get used in the chemical hydration process. Therefore, the         excess water remains in the concrete while the concrete cures. Over         time, this excess water evaporates out of the concrete and voids remain.         These voids weaken the concrete, causing less strength and more         cracking.The water-cement ratio matters to the engineer, but why does the         Construction Supervisor care? Anyone who has placed concrete knows how much         easier a flowing, more liquid concrete is to place than a drier         concrete. There is a tendency to add water to the mix, as it is ready to         be placed, to make the concrete flow better. In fact, if the concrete         doesn\u2019t flow well, it may not properly surround the rebar (causing a         poor bond with the rebar) or it may not flow properly against the forms         (causing voids and areas needing patching). Insert photo.So, a conflict often exists on the jobsite:Add water to the concrete mix to make it flow better, but weaken           the quality of the concrete (both strength and crack resistance)orDon\u2019t add water to the concrete mix to keep the proper           water-cement ratio but work harder to place the concrete and possibly           have significant voids.The easy answer is never add water on the site to concrete, but that         answer ignores the reality of the placement dilemma. This is often a         complicated decision, with Structural Engineers, Building Officials,         Specifications, Concrete Foreman and others all having input. It\u2019s         important the Construction Supervisor at least be aware of this issue for every         concrete placement and understand how the decision to add water will be         handled.",
  "What Should I Know About Concrete Testing?": "The concrete Slump Test was created to help consistently measure the concrete workability. The \"workability\" of the concrete is an important factor for those placing the concrete. A workable concrete mix properly flows and fills the form properly, leaving minimal voids at the form face and completely surrounding any rebar to create a bond.The Slump Test should be familiar to most workers on a construction         site. The wet concrete is placed in a steel cone form and placed on a         non-absorbent surface, with the wider portion of the cone being down.         The steel cone form is then lifted off, allowing the wet concrete to         slump down a bit, depending on the mix design. A dry mix may only slump         1\u201d to 2\u201d. Normally specified slump is around 4\u201d. Slumps of 6\u201d to 7\u201d can         be achieved through the use of high range water reducing agents         (super-plasticizers). Special mixes for pumping concrete tend to have         high slumps.Another important test for concrete is the cylinder compression test. Concrete strength is generally called its 28 day compressive strength.Why 28 days? What is magic about 28 days? Nothing. The 28 day period for         testing the compressive strength of concrete is an arbitrary time         selected to give consistency to the testing procedures. Thus, the 28 day         compressive strength of concrete has become the standard in the         industry. So when 4,000 psi concrete is specified for a concrete beam,         this means that the actual placed concrete should have a compression         strength above 4,000 psi after 28 days. Since the strength of concrete         continues to increase over time, a standard time period for concrete         strength measurement is necessary.The concrete cylinders that are made to determine the 28 day strength         can also be broken earlier and provide useful information. Cylinders are         commonly broken at 7 days, which normally have developed about 75% of         the 28 day strength. It\u2019s nice to know 3 weeks earlier if there is a         problem with a concrete batch.Breaking cylinders at 3 days can also yield useful data. If a         supported slab has been placed, the 3 day concrete breaks can be used to         determine if stripping or the forms and form supports will be safe. So         concrete cylinder breaks provide a number of useful bits of information.The basics of making the cylinders should be understood by the         Construction Supervisor. When the wet concrete is being placed, cylinders 6\u201d in         diameter and 12\u201d high are filled with concrete and carefully         consolidated, (see Making Concrete Cylinders for Testing). These         cylinders then cure, hopefully in conditions similar to the curing         conditions for the main concrete pour. The concrete cylinders harden in         a few hours and are stored for future testing.That testing consists of placing the cylinder in a machine that         presses on the cylinder top and bottom, adding axial force until the         cylinder crushes. The amount of force required to crush the cylinder         becomes the compressive strength for that cylinder.As an example: Note: do calcs in ink on paper and scan into the         document as a separate file.------------------------------------------For a concrete sample that is broken after 28 daysThe cylinder is 6\u201d diameter, so it has an area of 3.14 x Diameter         squared /4A = 3.14 x 6 x 6/4A = 28.26 square inchesIf the force required to break the cylinder was 97,500 poundsThen the compressive strength is 97,500 pounds / 28.26 square inches         = 3,450 psi------------------------------------------The Construction Supervisor also needs to pay attention to the care and         storage of the concrete test cylinders between the time they are made         and broken. A few years ago, during the construction of an addition to a         sewage pumping station building, the Construction Supervisor stored the concrete         test cylinders inside the pumping station for protection from harsh         weather. When the cylinders were broken at 28 days, the supposedly 4,000         psi concrete was achieving only 2,500 psi of compressive strength. Talk         immediately began about tearing out the new concrete walls and the         finger pointing for responsibility started. A core boring was taken from         the wall and the concrete tested well above the 4,000 psi requirement.So what happened? It seems no one considered what a constantly         vibrating pump room floor would do to the setting process of the         concrete. The moral of the story is that concrete test cylinders cause         enough problems on a project that the Construction Supervisor should have a         clear, agreed upon plan for their making, storing, breaking and         reporting.",
  "How Do I Get Concrete on the Job?": "Concrete can be mixed on site or purchased from vendors in Ready Mix         trucks. Ready Mix concrete has the ingredients mixed at the Ready Mix         plant according to a set recipe for the requested mix. The advantages of         Ready Mix concrete are the uniformity in handling the raw materials         (ingredients), the supplier\u2019s experience with how a certain mix design         will perform (3 day strength, 28 day strength, workability, etc.) and         convenience. The disadvantages of Ready Mix concrete can be the         following: long driving times (if plant is far from job site) in which         the concrete becomes less workable, difficulty in obtaining concrete at         times and quantities that are needed and cost.Concrete batch plants are utilized on large construction projects to         mix the concrete on site. The advantages of job site batch plants are         ability to get concrete in necessary times and quantities, eliminating         traveling issues, and cost. The disadvantages of concrete batch plants         are the amount of equipment, labor and job site space required to make         the process work and potential concrete quality problems since mix         designs will not have had much previous experience.Of course, for very small concrete projects, concrete can be mixed on         the job site by hand or in portable concrete/mortar mixers. It\u2019s         important to understand that concrete mixed in this way is unlikely to         be as uniform as Ready Mixed concrete, due to the variations inherent in         the process:Measuring (often done by shovels) will be much less precise.Moisture levels in sand and gravel will be unknown (thus adding           water to the mix).The water-cement ratio will be determined by feel rather than by           measurement.These issues don\u2019t mean that job site mixed concrete will be         unacceptable, only that the quality of the concrete will be much more         variable than Ready Mixed concrete. Therefore, the Construction Supervisor should         use caution in allowing job site mixed concrete if the final attributes         of the concrete are critical (i.e. if 4500 psi concrete is needed for         concrete columns or if any cracking of the floor would be a major         problem).If small quantities of concrete are to mixed on the job site, the         information provided in Figure 1.14 should be helpful.

  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Concrete Basics:": "Know the different concrete mixes specified for the project. Pay           attention not just to required 28 day strength (3,000 psi, 4,000 psi,           etc) but also to likely admixtures and additions to the mix.Know the concrete testing required for each concrete mix and have           a clear plan for how the testing will be accomplished.Get in the habit of looking at the rebar and understanding the           structural rebar locations and the temperature steel locations.Know how to read the markings on a piece of rebar to determine its           producing mill, bar size and type and grade of steel.",
  "What are the Basics of Concrete Footings?": "Concrete footings exist to transfer the structural loads from the         building (snow load, live load, dead load, wind load, earthquake load,         etc.) to the Earth. Obviously, the foundations on a building are         critical from a structural standpoint. However, since they are usually         unseen after backfilling, too many times the foundations are not built         without enough attention to detail.It\u2019s often said that any building project that doesn\u2019t come out of         the ground well will be difficult to ever get back on track. It\u2019s         important for the Construction Supervisor to understand both the function and the         acceptable tolerances on foundations. In order to understand the function, some terms need defined:Concrete spread footing under a single column: this footing           typically has the column in the middle of the footing. As the force           acts downward from the column, the spread footing distributes that           force to the soil. The bottom of the spread footing is in tension from           thebending momentcreated by the column force and the earth           resistance. Many typical spread footings with a single           column are designed using Construction Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) Tables for Footings. Engineers tend to           use these tables, or computer design software, rather than design footings manually each time. While this information is not in the public domain (so I can't just provide those tables here) you could pick up a used CRSI Design Handbook at a low cost.Concrete wall footing: this footing has continuous wall above. The forces acting downward through the wall are distributed by the wall footing to the Earth.Concrete spread footing under multiple columns: depending on the column locations and loads, the layout of this footing can           vary greatly. Footing           rebar is often required in the top and bottom of spread footings with           multiple columns because of changes in thebending moments.",
  "How do I Stage and Plan the Job for Footings?": "While some site work needs to proceed the footing installation, the         planning for the footings typically begins the building construction         process. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of getting that         beginning done right. All other building work follows the footings,         literally sitting upon them. Take the time to get the footing planning         and execution done well.One of the first steps in planning the footing work concerns the         location of the surrounding sub grade. In some instances, it\u2019s better to         keep the existing grade low, install the footings with minimal         excavation, then place the fill in the building after footing and         foundation wall excavation. In most instances, it\u2019s easier to bring the         building pad to final sub-grade prior to starting footing excavation.         This is a decision that should be evaluated on each project.The layout of the footings and what to do with the footing excavation         excess soil material should be considered together. Some         construction supervisor\u2019s use batter boards at each corner to give the line and         the grade of the building. Others use offset hubs to determine line and         an elevation benchmark for grade. With either method, you need to         consider how much offset is required from the actual wall lines in order         to accomplish the excavation. These items should be thought through in         advance of the actual layout and footing excavation in order to proceed         in the most effective manner.Also consider water related problems at his stage. What will a hard rain         do to the site in the middle of footing excavation? Will footings needed         pumped? Can they be gravity drained? Will mud be created and how will it         be dealt with? Since this is such an important project stage, it\u2019s         prudent to have some contingency plans ready for a few predictable         scenarios.The construction supervisor need not be paralyzed by planning, spending all his         time considering worst case scenarios. But the construction supervisor should         have put some thought into a few scenarios that may happen and at least         have an idea of how he will proceed. A bit of extra planning at this         stage just makes sense.",
  "How do I Place Concrete Footings?": "The actual installation of concrete footings varies greatly from job to         job. Sometimes footings need to be formed, many times earth forming         works fine (using the Backhoe bucket to neatly excavate the footing size         in the soil). The need for formwork in footings sometimes depends on the         building pad elevation, as discussed above.The rebar placement in the concrete footing stage generally will be         required to be inspected by the local building official. It\u2019s important         the proper clearances are available (3\u201d from earth, 1 \ufffd\u201d from forms,         etc.) in order to provide protection for the rebar from future         corrosion. It\u2019s also important to tie the rebar securely, due to all the         jostling and pushing that happens during footing concrete placement. The         rebar needs to be in the specified locations, not only before the         concrete is poured, but after.The concrete placement of footing again varies greatly depending on the         project circumstances. Sometimes the Ready Mix Concrete truck can run         along the footing trench and chute concrete directly into the footings.         Other times concrete buggies or wheel barrows need to carry the concrete         from the truck to the footing. Of course, some projects use concrete         pumps for transporting the concrete to the foundations.Before the concrete placement starts, the construction supervisor should discuss         some contingencies with the concrete foreman. For example, what happens         if the there is a plant shut down and the concrete trucks stop coming?         What route through the site may the concrete trucks use? Will this         change in foul weather? Where does any extra concrete from a truck get         placed? Where may Ready Mix concrete trucks wash out their mixers and         chutes?The construction supervisor should be especially vigilant about the concrete         footings. The method of layout should be approved and verified. The         concrete foreman should describe how he will get the top of footings at         the correct elevation. When earth forming is used, there are too many         cases when concrete footing elevations are too high or too low.There are several ways to make sure the footings are installed correctly         (temporary rebar grade stakes that get pounded down into the wet         concrete after grade is set, wet benching with a laser level and         establishing acceptable grade benches, or several other options). The         construction supervisor doesn\u2019t need to specify the method used, but does need to         understand it and agree that the proposed method will achieve acceptable         results. It\u2019s also valuable to wander by during the first few concrete         footing placements and verify that the proposed method is actually being         appropriately followed.",

  "What are the Basics of Slabs on Grade?": "People outside the construction business wonder what can be         complicated about a \u201ccement\u201d floor. If they only knew. The concrete         floor is often the most used, and noticed, part of the building. With         that amount of importance, one would think that we would usually get         them right. Unfortunately, it is all too rare that the concrete floor         meets the criteria of Owner, design professional and contactor through         out the life of the building.You may wonder, \u201cWhy is it so difficult to obtain and economical,         serviceable concrete floor.\u201d The best way to approach this question is         to examine some of the things that go wrong. Generally problems stem         from construction practices, materials, or improper design. A list of         concrete floor problems follows:Cracking \u2013 structuralCracking \u2013 shrinkageCurling- Top of slab shrinks more than bottom and slab edge lifts.Scaling \u2013 Hardened concrete breaking away from slab top in sheets           1/8\u201d to \ufffd\u201d thick.Dusting \u2013 Appearance of powdery material at slab surface.Crazing \u2013 Many fine hairline cracks in a new slab which resemble a           road map.Spalling \u2013 disintegration of concrete at joint edges.In order to avoid the above problems, all the details of a concrete         slab, from design to curing, must be performed appropriately. Due to the         importance of the floor, we will examine a step-by-step procedure for         obtaining an acceptable concrete slab-on-grade.The first step in the process is the concrete design mix. Rarely does         low quality concrete produce a high quality floor. A 4000 psi concrete         is recommended instead of a 3000 psi mix due to the higher cement         content and improved wear resistance. The Portland Cement Association         recommends that a commercial or industrial concrete floor use a concrete         with a three day compressive strength of 1800 psi. This requirement         provides early protection from construction traffic. Water-cement ratio         is also critical for concrete slabs-on-grade in order to minimized         shrinkage cracking.",
  "How do the Joints Work for Slabs on Grade?": "The proper design and location of joints is an area of confusion         throughout the construction industry. There are three types of joints:Isolation Joint \u2013 Used to prevent a bond and allow movement           between the slab and the adjoining structure.Control Joint \u2013 Used to induce shrinkage cracking at specific           locations.Construction Joint \u2013 Used to provide a stopping place for a           concrete pour. The construction joint can also be detailed to function           as an isolation or control joint.The basic theory of joints must be understood in order to use the         correct joint at the correct location. The isolation joint should be         used to allow the concrete floor and the rest of the structure to act         independently. There is not key way or bond of any type through an         isolation joint, allowing movement both horizontally and vertically.         The figure below illustrates a typical isolation joint detail and a plan of         an isolation joint at a steel column. The isolation joint at a column is         often in the diamond shape so the slab control joints stop on an         isolation joint corner (this reduces cracking). The isolation joint         diamonds must also be formed separately and poured after the floor slab.The joint sealing compound shown is another topic worthy of discussion.         The installation of joint sealers is costly because the expansion joint         material must be kept about \ufffd\u201d low and a removable strip installed. The         sealant installer can remove this strip and begin sealing. I have seen         many cases where joint sealant was shown on drawings, with perhaps a         less than full awareness of cost by the design professional, and then         never installed in the field.This is a bad situation for everyone, since the owner paid for something         he didn\u2019t get and the contractor left himself open for claims. When         joint sealant is shown on the drawings, I think it advisable to discuss         costs, requirements and details with the owner and design professional         to agree on what should be performed in the field.The control joint functions as a contraction joint, allowing the         shrinkage of the concrete slab to occur in one location rather than         random cracking in the slab. A control joint is a weakened plane in the         slab that is supposed to rack. If a crack appears two feet (and         parallel) from a control joint, one can be reasonably sure the control         joint did not create a weakened plane. Isolation joints always function         as control joints and construction joints usually do.Three types of pure control joints are shown in figure below. The saw cut         joints are sawed by a concrete saw as soon as the saw does not crack the         saw cut edges. If one waits a few hours too long to saw cut, the slab         shrinkage may have created its own cracks. A saw cut is typically         considered adequate to a depth of \ufffd the slab thickness. The induced         crack that form below the saw cut is usually jagged enough to continue         lock the slabs together and prevent differential settlement. It is also         possible, though not common, to use smooth dowels through a control         joint that are coated to prevent bond.For thicker slabs, a crack inducer can be placed on the sub-grade to         reduce the thickness of the saw cut required. Finally an insert can be         placed in the plastic concrete to create a control joint. The insert can         be a simple hardboard strip or one of several products on the market for         this use. Care must be taken to keep these pre-molded insert strips         straight while installing.A construction joint is first and foremost a place to start and stop         pouring concrete. The details of a construction joint can allow it to         act as a isolation joint, control joint, or continuous joint. The butt joint acts as an isolation         joint allowing both vertical and horizontal movement. The dowel control         and keyed joints both act as control joints, allowing horizontal         movement but preventing vertical movement. Finally the doweled         continuous joint should allow no movement.While the construction supervisor should never just change the concrete slab         joint details to something that seems to make more sense, he should         consider the joints required and make appropriate recommendations to the         owner or design/professional. Concrete floors are too much work to do a         second time.",
  "What Should I Know About Installing Slabs on Grade?": "The many specific details of forming, placing, finishing, and curing a         concrete slab are not included here. The information presented here         highlights trouble areas that a construction supervisor can concentrate on to try         to achieve an acceptable concrete floor. In order to review all the         specifics of concrete floor construction, however, I would recommend a         publication from the American Concrete Institute entitled \u201cConcrete         Craftsman Series \u2013 Slabs-On-Grade\u201d.An area of the floor system that is crucially important is the sub-grade         on sub-base. The most important item is proper compaction; many floors         settle and have structural cracks. Of course organic material can not be         properly compacted and must never be in the sub-grade. It is a simple         fact that the floor system rests on the grade and if the sub-grade         settles the floor settles.Particular attention should be paid to backfilling trench and footing         excavations under a floor. While it is worthwhile to make the contractor         perfuming the work responsible for the quality of backfill, the         construction supervisor should realize that his step, by itself, may not solve         the problem. The contractor backfilling under a future slab must clearly         understand the required quality level of the backfill and assure its         acceptability.Forming of concrete floors is reasonably straight forward. One must         remember, though, that loose or warped edge forms cause uneven floors.         Therefore, the care taken with the edge form setting will be         proportional to final flatness of the floor.Placing concrete in hot weather, particularly when the walls and roof         are not yet completed, creates some additional quality concerns. Plastic         cracking is one of the worse problems that occur. Plastic shrinkage         cracks form before the concrete hardens and are caused by hot, dry, and/or windy conditions. The cracks resemble the shrinkage cracks seen in clay soils during very dry weather.Curing can also create lots of problems for concrete floors. Since water         evaporates so quickly from the large exposed surface, without proper         curing methods a floor is likely to rack, craze and dust. The three most         common means of curing are:Wet cure by covering, after finishing, with continuously watered           burlap.Wet cure by watering finished slab and covering with plastic or           paper.Seal cure with liquid membrane curling compound.The construction supervisor should verify that the method chosen is acceptable to         the Owner and Design Professional.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Slabs on Grade:": "Plan for each isolation, control and construction joint, know and communicate the locations and details.If the concrete floor finish is critical and construction             traffic needs to be on it a few days after placement, get extra             concrete cylinders made to break at 3 days to assure 1800 psi             strength prior to using the floor.A smooth sub-grade, without ruts, yields a much better floor,             since the concrete can shrink and crack evenly instead of being             localized at a rut. Make sure the sub-base placement and the             concrete placement don\u2019t make ruts in the sub-grade.",
  "What Should I Know about Concrete Slabs?": "Reinforced concrete slabs are floors that are supported by walls,         beams or columns. Other than the tolerance for the floor surfaces, these         slabs are quite different than the slab-on-grade floors discussed         earlier. Reinforced concrete slabs are structural elements that require         great care in design, detailing, and installation. Consider the story         about the early years of reinforced concrete, in which the workmen         weren\u2019t willing to remove the shores on their first slab. It simply         didn\u2019t seem natural that concrete could span that far. The workman         thought that they\u2019d remove the shoring and the slab would come crashing         done on them. Of course, due to the beauty of reinforced concrete, it         didn\u2019t.A brief study of the types of slabs will help you understand how the         slabs actually carry the load. The figure below illustrates five types of         slabs. The one way slab is unsupported on two sides by         walls or beams. The distance \u201cL\u201d is important as the length of the span.         The main reinforcing steel in a one-way slab spans from support to         support.The two-way slab is more complex. The slab is supported on all four (4)         sides so part of the load is carried in the \u201cL\u201d direction and part in         the \u201cW\u201d direction. If the \u201cL\u201d length is greater that two (2) times the         \u201cW\u201d length (long, skinny slab) the slab functions like a one-way slab.         The reinforcing in a two-way slab spans in both directions.This information about different types of slabs can be helpful to a         construction supervisor if an Owner is considering a field change (as they so         often do). For example, if an Owner requests an additional rectangular         opening through a slab for process piping, the Construction Supervisor must         usually give an opinion on the spot. The opinion can be much more         accurate when understanding if the slab is one-way or two-way and which         way the opening should be turned. By the way, always check with the         Structural Engineer before making changes in structural reinforced         concrete work.The remainder of the slabs in the figure use columns, rather than beams         or walls, for support. The flat slab uses drop panels and column         capitals to reduce the stresses at the column-slab intersection. Where         spans are not too large, or loads to heavy, a flat pate is used. Its         simplicity makes forming more economical. Finally the grid slab (or         waffle plate) uses special forms to reduce the amount of concrete         required.Whichever type slab is used, great care must be taken in the forming and shoring considerations. Many construction fatalities have occurred in this area. The process must be thoroughly considered and planned, checked by capable reviewers and carefully executed. With the huge construction loads involved, everything must be done correctly. The forming and shoring of slabs must be completed carefully and correctly.",
  "What Should I Know about Concrete Walls?": "Concrete walls have many uses including retaining earth walls, tank walls,         shear walls in multi-story buildings, etc. A properly installed         cast-in-place concrete wall achieves excellent structural strength, fire         resistance and an attractive finish.The forming of concrete walls is typical labor intensive, always time         consuming, and sometimes downright unsafe. Too many accidents happen each year when forming concrete walls. The two most         important items in wall forming are the panel form itself and the wall         tie.Panel forms can be built out of plywood and lumber on the job or manufactured panel forms (such asSymons forms) can be used. On large concrete walls, gang         forming adds additional efficiency. Large sections of wall forms are put         together, lifted in place by the crane, and after the pour the crane         moves the gang form to the next pour location.Wall ties hold the forms on either side of the new concrete wall         together. Conventional types of wall ties are shown in Symons website. The         Design Professional may approve the type of tie used, but it will often be the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to determine wall tie         placement.Wall forms fail far too often and it is a lack of understanding that         usually causes the failure. The pressure on a wall form from a fluid         (wet concrete) is simply the product of the depth of the wall and the         density of the concrete. Therefore, if a 10 foot high concrete wall were         placed very quickly, the pressure at the bottom of the wall form will be10\u2019 x 150 pounds/cubic foot = 1500 pounds/square footAnd the pressure midway down the wall form will be 5\u2019 x 150 pounds/cubic foot = 750 psfIf the wall was formed with snap ties with a load limit of 2000 pounds,         the bottom of the wall would have a snap tie at one foot on center         horizontally and vertically. This solution doesn\u2019t seem very practical.         What has developed over the years, though, is a method of placing a         concrete wall in lifts, so the concrete lift previously placed takes a         set (no longer acts like a fluid) before the next lift is placed.With this method, the concrete vibrator penetrates a maximum of about         one foot into the previous concrete lift to establish a bond, but not to         the bottom of the form to keep all the concrete plastic (another work for fluid). Considering the ten foot high wall, if one chooses to use three (3) lifts the maximum for pressure will be 3.33\u2019 x 150 lbs/cf = 500 psf, then a wall tie that carries 2000 pounds could be placed every 4 square feet.You must be careful when forming concrete walls. Tremendous amounts of pressure exist and must be reckoned with. Far too many accidents occur because of shoddy workmanship and not taking the time to think about how the fluid concrete will act. Always consider the concrete a fluid and try to determine which part of the forming system is most likely to fail. Learn to think about failures, and how they may occur, in order to avoid them.",
  "How do Tilt-up Walls Work?": "Tilt-up concrete involves placing concrete as a slab-on-grade, (either on the         building floor or a temporary casting slab) and lifting the panel to         become a section of wall. Expensive wall forms are replaced with         inexpensive slab-on-grade forms. The process has been gaining popularity         since World War II and been aided by the development of heavy duty         cranes.Lifting a concrete slab from a horizontal position to a vertical         position causes significant additional stresses in the concrete. These         considerations must be analyzed by a Structural Engineer and         reinforcement and lifting inserts located. Specifically who         provides this information varies among projects, but it definitely is         not a case where the Construction Supervisor can \u201cwing it\u201d.In order to get a better understanding of tilt-up concrete go to theDayton Superior Corporation websiteto learn about the various products used in the process.",
  "What Should I Know about Concrete Columns, Piers and Beams?": "Concrete beams and columns are typically detailed reasonably clearly         on the structural drawings. While the Design Professional reviews the         reinforcing steel shop drawings for conformance to design, the         Construction Supervisor should review the shop drawings to verify that the         dimensions are correct and that everything will fit. Reviewing for fit includes plenty of things and the Construction Supervisor may         wonder why this checking shouldn\u2019t be someone else\u2019s responsibility.         Perhaps it should be. The reality of the industry, though, is that the         Construction Supervisor has to put the project together and make it work.For example, a concrete beam and column intersection may appear quite         straight forward on the contract drawings, but the reinforcing steel         shop drawings show the bar sizes and splices which at this location         allow no room for the concrete between bars. Probably other people         should have caught this problem previously, but the Construction Supervisor has         to deal, immediately when discovered in the field, with the cost,         schedule and performance implications of this problem. In many cases,         the Construction Supervisor\u2019s experience allows him to guess at the potential         problem areas and review those areas carefully. Incredible amounts of         time, money and frustration can be saved by catching the problem on         paper rather than in the field. So the Construction Supervisor should carefully review rebar shop drawings for concrete columns, piers and beams, paying special attention to intersecting areas.Years ago it was common practice for the Structural Engineer to show the reinforcing steel only where it was actually needed in the concrete beam. This practice meant less reinforcing steel used, but more exacting detail of the shapes and placement of the bars that were used. With the rise of labor costs, it became more economical to use more, simpler reinforcement to improve steel tying production. This change means there is more reinforcing steel in splice areas and intersection areas, making the coordination more important.",
  "What Should I Know about Precast Concrete?": "Using precast concrete often improves cost and efficiency. With         skilled construction labor more scarce, and thus more expensive, the use         of factory production measures to build structures becomes more         practical. A precast plant can produce column, beams, wall panels, floor         units and roof units in standardized shapes and large quantities. The         members are then shipped to the project and erected. Specifically, some         of the advantages of precast concrete are as follows:Less skilled labor requirements.Less overall labor cost per member installed due to mass           production techniques.Controlled production conditions allow maximum use of available           construction material (i.e. higher strength concrete and steel, less           reinforcing steel clearance requirements, etc.)Improved construction schedules because the concrete work can be           performed off site prior to when it could start on site.Final quality control less dependent on weather and season.Of course, these are some disadvantages to precast concrete which         include:Difficulties and costs involved with transportationTechnical and cost aspect of site precast connectionsAll things considered, though, precast concrete has some very strong         advantages for certain construction projects.With this in mind, the Construction Supervisor should         understand what typical precast products are available. Some people         mistakenly believe that a precast plant makes a totally new set of         members for each project. Actually the precast industry has developed         many standard members, with variations, which are normally specified.         All the special requirements and conditions of a particular project are         then integrated into those standard members.One of the most common uses of precast concrete is for floor decks. The hollow core precast decks use high strength prestressed reinforcing and have open cores to lower the weight. To find specific load tables and information about hollow core precast decks, go to:http://oldcastlesystems.precastdev.com/menu_ps.asp?NodeId=1187708859&Group_ID=1117647250&Parent_ID=-1For other structural elements, including precast Tee decks, precast columns, and precast beams, go to:http://www.spancrete.com/ae_loadtables.php?location=3As in many areas of construction, the shop drawings are produced by         the fabricator and show all the necessary details to fabricate and         install the work. The Construction Supervisor must pay particular attention to         the precast shop drawings because of the nature of precast (meaning         precast members are more difficult to change, cut or add to in the field         than steel or wood). To review the precast show drawings with a strong         consideration given to the work of the other trades can greatly simplify         a job. While it may be easy to place some conduits in the precast form         in the casting yard, drilling for that bent conduit after erection can         be quite a challenge. It is prudent to give precast shop drawings to         other trades to review and make suggestions for working together.After the shop drawings are approved, fabrication can begin. If the         precast is an important element in the construction project, it is         worthwhile for the Construction Supervisor to continue to track it through the         fabrication stages. This is an area where many people relax and         subsequently find themselves in trouble. Typically, fabrication begins         with an acceptable agreement between the Precast Supplier and the         Construction Supervisor to ship at a certain time. It is easy to allow the \u201cout         of sight, out of mind\u201d syndrome to take over (and often it works) but it         is too important to leave to chance. Talk with the fabricator as the         work progresses, if possible, talk to the actual supervisor of the work.         Perhaps visit the plant. In general, make the commitment from the         Precast Supplier be understood by the people doing the work. A word of         caution here: This type of activity should foster teamwork not create         enemies. As in many management tasks, the way it\u2019s done is as important         as what is done.Prior to when the precast members arrive on the job, a plan for         erection should be clearly agreed upon. This plan includes the         following:The starting crane locationThe plan for crane movesThe ending crane locationFrequency of member shipmentTruck access to site and traffic control (where trucks go if           setting slows)Other trades not working under craneSpecial setting tolerances or guaranteed openings.In short, as many details and considerations as possible should be planned. Many over-worked Construction Supervisors will say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly find the time to spend that much time on one item.\u201d My response to that thought is that you must pick the few items that are most critical to the project and make the time to assure their correct completion. I know that every detail on the project is important, but the practice of this technique makes one realize that most of the smaller details get done anyway. This idea is the time management concept of prioritizingMake sure to have other trades, particularly the Plumbing Contractor, HVAC Contractor, Electrical Contractor, etc. review the precast shop drawings prior to approval.",
  "How to Plan for Concrete Stairs?": "Reinforced concrete stairs have a clear use, i.e. carry pedestrian traffic from one level to another. Simple sets of stairs are designed as a one-way slab that is inclined. More complex stairs may have multiple, unsupported landings, radiuses walls, etc.The first important decision regarding stairs for the Construction Supervisor is         when to start the work. Some successful projects start the stairs during         the structure erection while others leave the stairs until later in the         project. Think carefully how you need to get workers and materials from floor to floor during the various construction phases.When thinking about when to schedule the stairs, consider the following:Flow of people from floor to floor during construction.Parts of stairs that are a finished product (exposed) that may be           damaged in early phases of construction.Tie-in and scheduling of immediately adjacent areas.As a final thought on stairs: a reinforced concrete, cantilevered or spiral stairs can be a           beautiful piece of craftsmanship.

  "What is Masonry?": "Masonry consists of building structures by laying individual masonry units (brick, concrete block, stone, etc). Normally the masonry units are laid with cement mortar, which binds them together to create a structure. Masonry construction can provide beautiful walls and floors at economical prices. Due to the individual masonry units, masonry construction tends to be quite labor intensive. Because of the cement, clay or stone nature of the masonry materials, masonry construction tends to be durable and often requires little maintenance.\u00a0 An excellent introduction to the basics skills and concepts of masonry work is found in the US NavyBuilder Training Course Volume #1.Similar to concrete, masonry tends to be high in compressive strength but low in tension strength. To get a better understanding of the structural advantages and challenges of masonry, see the section onStructural Basics for Concrete. Crack control tends to be a major concern in masonry structures and normally is addressed by Design Professionals on the Plans.",
  "What Types and Sizes of Concrete Masonry Units are Available?": "Concrete masonry units (CMU) are some of the most commonly used materials in building construction. Due to their relatively low cost as wall material and their fire resistance, CMU walls are laid on many types of projects. From schools to warehouses, many buildings have CMU walls. It's valuable to understand the types and sizes of CMUs commonly available. Since CMUs are produced by private manufacturing firms, there is really no limit to the various of CMU types and sizes that could be produced. The following link shows commonly available CMU types and sizes from one firm:http://www.newhollandconcrete.com/images/images9021/Products/Gray/graysizes.pdf.You may want to consider printing out these shapes and sizes if you want to better understand what options the Masonry Contractor has for completing their portion of the project. Or, if you have convenient web access, you can just come back to this link as needed.Many specialty CMU products are also available:Split faceGround faceSand blastedMatte faceScored and ribbedLight weightAcousticalInsulatedSpecifics about types and sizes of these various CMUs can be found at the following website:http://www.newhollandconcrete.com/default.aspx?portalid=9021&tabid=172&pageid=Arch_Msnry",
  "What Types and Sizes of Bricks are Available?": "Bricks are a hardened clay product used for over 5,000 years. The Bible story about Moses and the Egyptian Pharaoh discusses the making of bricks by the Israelite slaves. The ancient brick size was a length to width to depth ratio of 4:2:1, which is still common today.Modern brick are typically manufactured in one of the following processes: soft mud, dry press or wire cut. In the soft mud process, the clay and sand are mixed with water, and often lime or ash, to a soft, mud-like consistency then pressed into steel molds by hydraulic presses. The bricks then are fired in ovens to increase strength. This process tends to be the lowest cost..The dry press process seems similar to the soft mud process, except the process uses a thicker, drier clay mix and more hydraulic power to push the mix into the molds. The dry press process achieves more defined edges and consequently costs a bit more.Brick color comes from the heat of the firing and changes with various added minerals. Sample brick panels are often laid on construction projects to show the variation of brick colors (and mortar colors and type of joint), so the final product on the building matches the approved sample.The following website shows lots of brick types and sizes:http://www.glengerybrick.com/brick/index.html",
  "How Do Lintels Work?": "As mentioned above, masonry and concrete tend to be strong in compression but weak in tension. In olden times, builders took advantage of this fact by the use of arches above door and window openings. Arches are an interesting structural form because they act totally in compression. Therefore, arches above windows have the downward load of the wall and floor/roof loads above transferred around the arch keeping the structure in compression, so tension cracks didn\u2019t occur in the masonry arch. Barrel vault ceilings are really just three dimensional arches, so they also worked as compression members only..A lintel is defined as a horizontal structural member supporting the wall load above a window or door. Lintels can be precast concrete, steel structural shapes, stone, wood or other products. Some common lintel types are shown below. The Construction Supervisor should be aware of the concept of arch action with regard to lintel design. A lintel designed for arch action only needs to carry the actual wall weight in the 45 degree angle triangle directly above the opening. Since typical precast CMU lintels are designed this way, if a change that places a concentrated load in this triangle happens during the course of the project, the Construction Supervisor should understand the ramifications and point it out to the Design Professional.Figure 4.1Construction Supervisors should also pay attention to the likelihood of lintels rusting and discoloring the facade. On many projects, steel lintels rust through the paint after a year or two and look bad. Sometimes steel lintels are required to be galvanized or factory powder coated, in these cases the lintels only need to be protected from scratches before and after installation. If no coating is specified, it's not uncommon for primed steel, or even rusty steel to be installed and painted after it's in place. Since a lintel can't be effectively painted after it's installed, the Construction Supervisor should attempt to make sure lintels are properly primed and painted prior to installation.",
  "How Does Steel Reinforcing Get Used in Masonry?": "Since CMUs and mortar have high compression strength but low tension strength, manufacturers have determined many steel products to help achieve stronger and more serviceable walls. Rebar can be added in masonry walls, with cores grouted solid, to substantially increase the load carrying capacity of a wall. Generally the Structural Engineer designates the size of the rebar and the spacing. Since CMU cores are usually on 8\" centers, the common spacing is 8\", 16\", 24\", 32\" or 48\" on center.There are also specialty CMU products that allow rebar to be run horizontally. Bond beam are designed for this purpose, as are open ended CMUs. When using these products, grout bonds the rebar to the CMUs making an integral wall. An important item for the Construction Supervisor to watch concerns the grout used in this reinforced masonry. Many times the Structural Engineer specifies the grout to be a concrete grout, say 3,000 psi, with pea size aggregate. It's easiest for the Masonry Contractor just to use the same mortar he's using to lay the wall. If no one pays attention, a 1,200 psi mortar may be installed instead of the specified 3,000 psi concrete grout. Obviously, this becomes a difficult problem to go back and fix.In order to get an understanding of the various wall ties, joint reinforcement and other masonry products available, the following website provides excellent information:http://www.dur-o-wal.com/prod/index.html. Generally the Project Documents should show the required information, but it's good to know what is available.",
  "What Should I Know about Mortar and Grout?": "Mortar binds the masonry units together. Commonly made from a mixture of Portland Cement and lime, sand and water, mortar mixes are usually specified for in the Contract Documents for a project. There are mortar systems that are produced offsite and delivered to the jobsite (Ready-Mixed Mortars), but most mortar gets mixed in the field. Due to the field mixing of mortar, it's important the mortar ingredients and mix be consistent throughout the project. While this responsibility typically falls to the Masonry Contractor, the Construction Supervisor should notice if the mixing process seems to proceed in a quality fashion. If ingredients are stored such that foreign elements become mixed into the mortar, if the measuring process seems haphazard from one batch to the next, or if the consistency of the mortar seems to vary between batches, the Construction Supervisor may head off future problems by noticing these issues and discussing with the Masonry Contractor. The Construction Supervisor can't catch every problem on a job site, but can pay attention to best quality practices and develop the habit of noticing where future problems are likely to arise.Mortars types are typically Type M, S, N or O. A basic understanding of these mortar types is helpful. All mix quantities given below are volume proportions (as opposed to weight proportions).Type M mortar is the highest strength (2500 psi average compressive strength at 28 days) and is often used for below grade structures such as foundations walls and storm water structures. It has typical proportions being 1 part Portland Cement, 1/4 part lime and 6 parts sand.Type S mortar is the next highest in strength (1,800 psi average compressive strength at 28 days) and is the general purpose high strength mortar. It tends to be the highest cost of the mortar mixes and has proportions of 1 part Portland Cement, 1/2 part lime and 4 1/2 parts sand. Most reinforced masonry walls will use Type S mortar and it's also specified for many other uses.Type N mortar is a medium strength mortar (750 psi average compressive strength at 28 days) and tends to be used for above grade walls in moderate wind areas. The workability of Type N mortar is quite high due to the higher proportion of lime in the mix. Typical mix quantities are 1 part Portland Cement, 1 part lime and 6 parts sand. Type N and Type M mortars are lower cost than Type S mortar.Type O mortar is a low strength mortar (350 psi average compressive strength at 28 days) used only for non-load bearing interior walls. It is the lowest cost mortar with mix proportions of 1 part Portland Cement, 2 parts lime and 9 parts sand. It is rare to see Type O mortar specified, but it is allowable to use per the International Building Code 2006. A more detailed understanding of mortar properties can be obtained with the following free download from the Portland Cement Association:http://www.cement.org/bookstore/profile.asp?store=&id=262Grouts are either fine grouts (Portland Cement, lime and sand) or coarse grout (Portland Cement, lime, sand and coarse aggregate). Typically the Structural Drawings define the type of grout required and the properties: strength, maximum aggregate size, etc. Since Masonry Contractors often seem to use the currently mixed mortar for grout, because it's easier, the Construction Supervisor should make sure a clear understanding exists as to the grout requirements.The grouting method can be low lift grouting or high lift grouting. Low lift grouting is a simple method of placing grout at scaffold height (prior to building the next lift of scaffold) or bond beam height. Vertical rebar, if required, are often placed in the cores after grouting and stirred to help consolidate the grout. The bar lap for the vertical rebar is often a minimum of 30 bar diameters. One difficulty with low lift grouting involves the lifting of the next courses of concrete masonry units over the rebar dowels that project after each grout lift.High lift grouting, on the other hand, allows the Masons to grout the wall for the entire story (up to 24') and is more complex. The size of the open vertical cells needs to be evaluated and 3\" x 4\" clean out openings at the bottom of the grout lift should be used. The high lift grouting method makes economical use of the grout pump and minimizes laps in vertical rebar, which both add to overall jobsite efficiency.With either grouting method, making sure grout actually fills the wall voids designated to be filled is an area often missed on job sites. There should be a method agreed upon for filling wall voids that assures the grout gets all the way to the bottom. The Construction Supervisor should be aware of the likelihood of failure in this area and take steps to make sure the process is done correctly.",
  "Why are Movement Control Joints So Important?": "Buildings move. Sometimes movements come from temperature related expansion and contraction. Or perhaps structural loads from wind, snow, or vibration get movement started. Of course, foundation settlement also moves buildings. Due to the tendency for masonry to crack easily (low tension strength), movement control must be considered for proper construction of masonry walls.One common method of dealing with masonry wall cracking is to improve the tensile strength of the wall. Bond beams utilize special cmu shapes that allow rebar to be placed horizontally and grouted full. Steel horizontal joint reinforcement also can be used at 8\" to 24\" on center and laid directly in the horizontal masonry joint. Different styles of horizontal joint reinforcement can be found at:http://www.dur-o-wal.com/prod/index.html.Control joints are used to relieve masonry tensile stresses and allow movement to occur. Typically a pre-formed rubber gasket is used at vertical control joints to transfer the shear load (normally wind load) across the joint but still allowing the joint to move horizontally. Masonry control joints should be shown in Contract Documents. The following table gives guidelines for control joint spacing:Control Joint Spacing for Concrete Block Construction(Type 1, moisture controlled units)Horizontal Joint Reinforcement, vertical spacingMaximum spacing for control jointsNone24\"16\"8\"Max ratio of cmu wall panel width to height: W/H22.534Max cmu wall width, regardless of height40'45'50'60'",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Masonry:": "Understand that lintels are normally designed to only carry the triangle of wall above them and notice if loads are applied that exceed lintel capacity.Make sure steel lintels, if not galvanized or factory powder coated, are properly primed and painted on all surfaces prior to installation (since lintels can't be effectively painted after installation).Think about temporary bracing of masonry walls as a structural engineer would.CMU walls may span 18 times their thickness (i.e. 18' for an 12\" thick wall) for load bearing and exterior non-load bearing walls or 36 times their thickness for interior non-load bearing walls. Empirical masonry design IBC 2003, 2109.4.Portland Cement is normally sold in 94 pound bags because one cubic foot of Portland Cement weighs 94 pounds.Make sure mortar doesn't get used when grout is specified.Understand where masonry control joints must be placed before any work begins.",
  "Why Use Steel?": "Steel construction has so many advantages: the strength to weight ratio is excellent, metals join easily, efficient shapes are available, etc. With those advantages, though, come some challenges that are best solved by a good understanding of how the metals actually perform in a structure.For most larger buildings, metals are a key element of the structural system. Steel beams and columns, steel joists, steel studs, aluminum framing are a few examples of metal construction. A wise Superintendent understands not only how to erect the structure, but also the basics of how the structural system works and the ways in which it fails.The Kansas City Hyatt Hotel structure spectacularly failed a few years ago, with a suspended walkway crashing to the ground. Many people were hurt and killed. The cause was traced to what seemed to be a minor change made during construction. This minor change, however, was structurally significant, increasing the shear stress well beyond design limits. The following link tells the story in more detail:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapseThe lesson learned from the Kansas City Hyatt Regency hotel collapse is that structural steel design, shop drawing review, fabrication and erection must be carefully done, with responsibilities clearly understood.",
  "Do You Want a Brief History of Steel?": "To understand metals, start with iron. As a basic chemical element Fe, iron is the most abundant metal on Earth. For many centuries, iron furnaces have heated limestone and iron ore that was excavated from the ground. The intense heat melts the both the rock and iron ore, along with several chemical reactions and the lighter liquid rock rises to the top and the heavier liquid iron sinks, creating pig iron. This pig iron is an intermediate step on the way to a final product.Historically, wrought iron was a building product made from this pig iron. The wrought iron was mostly pure iron (with some slag and small amounts of carbon added). Wrought iron was actually \u201cwrought\u201d (i.e. worked or hammered) into bars and has been used as a construction material for thousands of years. Wrought iron is tough and ductile, easy to weld. Lacking the carbon content for tempering, wrought iron is not hard enough to hold a good edge for a tool or weapon.Other final products from the pig iron are alloys. An alloy is a combination of two or more elements, in which at least one is a metal. Most metals used for construction purposes are alloys. For example, steel is an alloy with iron and carbon being the primary elements. Generally, iron-carbon alloys with up to 2.1% carbon by weight are considered steel and iron-carbon alloys with greater amounts of carbon are cast iron.Cast iron is made by re-melting pig iron in a blast furnace, removing undesirable elements like phosphorus and sulfur, adjusting carbon levels and adding other elements. The resulting alloy, commonly called grey cast iron, has a high corrosion resistance and strong compressive strength, but tends to be brittle and difficult to weld. Historically, cannons and cannon balls were made from grey cast iron, as well as some early bridges.Steel is an alloy that finds tremendous number of uses in today\u2019s construction world. Hot rolled steel shapes, most commonly found as steel beams and columns on construction projects, are created in steel mills by rolling the heat steel between large rollers, deforming the steel into the typical shapes: W, S, C, angles, tube sections, pipes, etc. Most hot formed steel is either 36,000 psi or 50,000 psi yield strength.",

  "What Sheet Metal Gauges are Available?": "Sheet metal gets used in many applications, from forms for concrete pours on structural steel to flashings. Thetable below illustrates the available gauges for steel, galvanized steel and aluminum sheet metals:",
  "Why are Connections so Important in Structural Steel?": "Most structural steel failures happen at connections....where a beam connects to a column, where a joist connects to a beam, where a hanging rod connects to a beam (the Kansas City Hyatt discussed above). The Structural Engineer must design the design the steel members and give guidelines for the connections. Many people in the Construction Industry don't understand, though, that the Structural Engineer rarely designs the connections.Why is that? Historically, the Steel Fabricators developed many different ways to make connections. What one Fabricator did in his shop economically might have been quite an expensive way to do it in a competitor's Fabrication Shop. So the practice developed that the Structural Engineer would size the members, but the Steel Fabricators would design the connections, which the Structural Engineer should then review and approve. If you think that seems like a complicated system prone to error, you'd be correct.But that is the system we generally have in American construction. So the Construction Supervisor should know something about steel connections and have an idea if they are being installed correctly. A bit of background inBasic Structural Designis helpful, but the main thing to understand is the concept of pin connections versus fixed connections.A beam bolted to a column with clip angles along the beam web likely creates a pin connection. This means that the beam shouldn't be able to move up or down, nor in or out, but it can rotate a bit. A steel column bolted to a concrete pier with four anchor bolts also typically creates a pin connection. Again the steel column won't go up, down or sideways, but it may be able to rotate a bit.The fixed connection must stop that ability to rotate. So for a beam to have a fixed connection to a column, along with clip angles, there may be a plate on the top and bottom flanges of the beam that gets welded to the column. With all that welding, the beam can no longer rotate. If a steel column is buried four feet deep in a concrete pier, it also would not be rotating at the point that it exits from the concrete. So those are a couple of ways to create fixed (or moment resisting) connections.The Construction Supervisor should be aware if any fixed (or moment resisting) connections are required and understand how they are to be made. Just asking the questions increases the likelihood of a successful project.",
  "What is Composite Design?": "Composite design marries some of steel and concrete's best attributes together for an efficient structural system. Let's start by thinking about a structural system that isn't composite design. Structural steel beams placed at 4' on center with a steel deck spanning perpendicular which will have 4\" of concrete placed on top of the steel deck is not a composite system. That means the steel beams will carry their own weight, the weight of the steel deck and concrete above and whatever live load gets applied. The steel deck and the concrete must carry their own weight and the live load spanning from steel beam to steel beam. Another way to state the proposition: the steel beam acts on its own structurally and the steel deck and concrete act on their own structurally.A composite system ties together that steel beam and concrete floor and forces them to act as a single structural unit. Some connector on top of the steel beam makes the steel and concrete act as one unit. The steel beam can't slide independently of the concrete slab, the two are bonded together. Since the concrete is strong in compression, the composite system can be quite efficient structurally. The figure below illustrates the concept.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Structural \rSteel:": "Learn the names of the basic structural steel hot rolled shapes (W, HP, S, C, etc).W, S, and M structural steel shapes tell their height and weight in their name (a W8 x 31 is 8\" high and weighs 31 pounds per foot).Always check if there are fixed (moment resisting) steel connections on the project.Always check if a slab above steel beams acts as a composite system.",
  "What Should I Know about Steel Joists and Deck?": "A steel joist and deck structural system for floors above grade often is the most economical floor system, particularly for areas with a low\u00a0 likelihood of earthquakes. Steel joists use the truss structural principle, which results in a very high load capacity to member weight ratio. A common floor design is steel joists at 2' on center, with a 28 gauge form deck spanning perpendicular to the joists and 3\" or 4\" of concrete floor placed on the form deck.The website below provides excellent, free downloadable catalogs for steel joists and deck:http://ww1.newmill.com/services/download_catalog.htmlOne of the challenges to installing this type of floor system regards the flatness of the floor. Frankly, it's difficult to get a flat floor. Since the joist and deck floor system is so efficient, there tends to be a good bit of deflection in the joists when under load. A few big construction workers, gathered in one spot while placing the concrete deck, can create some noticeable joist deflections. Then the concrete tends to get placed thicker in that area, since the deck is lower. When the workers move, the deck may come up or it may be permanently deflected due to the extra concrete weight. It's not impossible to get a flat floor, but it is a challenge.Welding of the steel deck should also be carefully monitored. The specification should detail how often the deck should be welded to the steel joists and how often side lap welds are required. Sometimes these welds get made haphazardly and don't create the necessary bonds.Whenever you work on raised floor systems, be careful about fall protection. Many workers die each year from falls. Learn to look critically at the safeguards that are in place. Make sure the temporary railings really are erected correctly and that they stay in place. It's a truth on the construction site that temporary railings get in the way and get taken down. The Construction Supervisor should plan for that fact and make sure that a floor stays protected from fall hazards. The alternative can be quite ugly.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Steel Joist and \rDeck:": "Be aware of floor deflections when placing concrete on steel joists and deck.Check welding quality and quantity of steel decks to steel joists.Make sure temporary railings get erected correctly and stay in place for fall protection.",
  "What is Cold Formed Steel Framing?": "Cold formed steel framing (also called metal studs or lightweight steel framing systems) makes the steel shapes differently than the hot rolled structural steel. The cold forming process passes steel sheets between large rollers to deform the steel, but at a lower temperature than hot rolling. The rolling process compresses and stretches the steel, hardening it in the process. Most cold rolled steel is either 33,000 psi or 50,000 psi yield strength.The typical shapes and their sizes and attributes are shown at this website:http://www.loseke.com/lgsi.html(which has all the technical information available about cold formed steel framing). At the site listed above, you can scroll down the left menu to find the properties of C sections and Z sections.",
  "What Should I Know about Steel Studs and Joists?": "Steel studs and joists get used in conventional construction to build walls (interior, exterior, bearing, and non-bearing) as well as roofs and floors. Almost every type of structure that previously got built with wood studs and wood joists now can be built with steel studs and joists. So why would anyone change from wood?Cold formed steel doesn't shrink and warp like wood, so walls tend to be straighter.The building code offers some advantages for using \"Non-Combustible\" construction (which includes steel studs and joists) rather than the \"Combustible\" construction of wood.Depending on commodity pricing, sometimes steel stud walls cost less than wood stud walls...but other times they don't.Did you ever think about how you learned to build wood stud walls? You probably built them on the concrete slab, then tilted them up into position. That method of building walls really moves quickly. The reason it works so well is that wood, when screwed or nailed, tends to pull together at the joints. Steel stud walls won't work that way. When steel stud walls are pre-built in factories, hydraulic jigs press them together for welding. So steel stud walls built on the jobsite generally get built vertically, one stud at a time.The headers used in steel stud walls often are C channels toed-in (which means facing each other to create a box). If the wall needs to be insulated, make sure to insulate any box type members as they are being built, because you obviously can't get the insulation in afterwards. Note: this issue becomes a problem because the Insulation Contractor often isn't on the project when the walls are being built.",
  "What Should I Know about Steel Girts and Purlins?": "Pre-Engineered buildings typically use cold formed steel girts in the walls and purlins in the roofs, spanning 20' to 30'. If you're building a Pre-Engineered steel building, the building manufacturer will have lots of details for how to install the girts and purlins. Make sure you have a copy of the recommended installation details on site, though, and take some time to get familiar with it.I've built a few conventional steel buildings (usinghot formed rolled steel membersfor columns and beams) and found details harder to find. So if you build this type building (often used for industrial facilities) make sure to work out the details with the Design Professional. This really is a case where asking permission is better than asking forgiveness. If the details aren't clear, don't assume you know what makes sense, as many different (sometimes not common sense issues) may be in play in these cases.",

  "Aluminum": "Aluminum is non-magnetic and sometimes used as structural members in construction projects. The weight of aluminum is roughly 1/3 the weight of steel, but the yield strength is also roughly 1/3 that of steel.\u00a0 Aluminum also resists corrosion well. Aluminum is actually an element in the periodic table, but pure aluminum has a very low tensile strength and is rarely used. Most products called aluminum are actually aluminum alloys, produced by combining aluminum with small amounts of some of the following: copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, tin, titanium, lithium, silicon, etc.So as a light weight metal that is resistant to corrosion, aluminum has many uses on a construction project. The typical shapes and their sizes and attributes are shown at this website, as well as excellent descriptions of attributes of various available alloys:http://www.alcoa.com/aep/distribution/en/product_category.asp?cat_id=53.",
  "Stainless Steel": "Stainless steel also has many uses in the construction field, normally when corrosion resistance is required. The various types of stainless steel do not stain, corrode or rust as easily as regular steel. Stainless steel has a minimum of 10% chromium content and there are at least 15 different common grades of stainless steel available. The typical shapes and their sizes and attributes are shown at this website:http://www.stainless-structurals.com/.All the steels and irons mentioned above are magnetic, except certain types of stainless steel.

  "What is an R Value?": "The R value is the material's thermal resistance toconductionheat transfer. In simple terms, the R value shows how a material retards heat flow. So 3 1/2\" thick piece of wood has an R value of 4, while that same thickness of fiberglass batt insulation has an R value of 13. If we go to 3 1/2\" ofpolyisocyanurate foam, the R value jumps to 23, since that type of foam has the highest R value of common building materials. So the higher the R value, them more the material resists heat flow, that is to say, the higher the R value, the better the insulation value of the material.It's valuable to remember the basic insulation values per inch for common insulations:R value per inch of insulation1.\u00a0 Fiberglass batt insulation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.52.\u00a0 Molded expanded polystyrene foam board (white board)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 43.\u00a0 Extruded expanded polystyrene foam board (blue board)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 54.\u00a0 Polyisocyanurate foam board (foil backed board)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 6.5The following US Department of Energy sitehttp://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11620provides lots of information about R values and insulation products.All the above concerns the transmission of sound (noise) from one space to another. What about how sound acts within one space?",
  "How Does the R Value Relate to the U Value?": "The U value is simply the inverse of the R value. So U = 1/R. Or R = 1/U. The U value often gets used in Building Codes, particularly for the energy conservation analysis. So understand that a 6\" fiberglass batt insulation with a R value of 19 has a U value of 1/19 or 0.053.",
  "Does the Hot or the Cold Side Get the Vapor Barrier?": "Most folks know that thevapor barriergets installed to limit moisture transmission. Warm moist air leaking through a wall becomes a problem when it cools down to the dewpoint temperature and condenses (drips) the water out of the air. Water dripping in insulation not only seriously degrades the insulation value but often can start the process of mold formation. So it's important to build in a way to not have condensation in the walls and ceilings.A common question in construction involves the actual placement of the vapor barrier. Think about batt insulation with Kraft paper backing. Does the Kraft paper get installed facing the inside of the building or the outside? You may be sure you know the answer to that question, but it may be a bit more complicated than you think.If you work in a colder climate, you'd answer that the Kraft paper vapor barrier definitely goes on the living side of the space (the warm in winter side). And you'd be right, sort of. If you work in a hot and humid climate, you'd answer that the Kraft paper vapor barrier definitely goes on the outside of the space (the warm in summer side). And you'd be right, sort of. The correct answer is that the installation depends on the project location.In cold climates, the vapor barrier should be on the inside (warm in winter), to stop the moisture from the heated winter air from getting too far into the insulation, where it would get colder and condense. On the other hand, in hot and humid climates, the vapor barrier goes on the outside, since the primary HVAC activity will be air conditioning (cooling). The hot outside air will be stopped at the exterior, so it can't get into the cooler inside space and condense in the wall.The following site gives some additional information, as well as a map for the USA that delineates the cold and hot/humid climates:http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11810",
  "What Should I Know about Noise Control?": "Insulation helps control noise. Think about an apartment building. The sound transmission between the floors and the walls greatly affects how one enjoys the experience of living in the apartment. If you can hear your neighbors every time they talk and walk, you will value the apartment much less than if you have silence. So several measures developed to compare sound transmission and absorption.The Sound Transmission Class (STC) ratings provide a number that compares the noise levels that pass through different assemblies of walls or ceilings. A wall with wood studs at 16\" oc and 5/8\" gypsum wallboard on either side has a STC around 37. On the other hand, a double stud wall with 2 layers of gypsum wallboard on either side and batt insulation has a STC of 57. So the single stud wall blocks 37 decibels (dB) of sound transmission while the double stud wall blocks 57 dB. Measuring sound pressures is tricky and depends on the frequencies measured, but the decibel reduction is roughly accurate.Since the decibel scale is logarithmic, each increase of 10 decibels is a doubling of sound pressure. So the increases in the STC values really improve the walls performance.In practical terms, you could distinctly hear loud speech through that 37 STC wall, people tend to call walls like that \"paper thin\". I've built plenty of those STC 57 walls in apartment buildings and the noise complaints about neighbors are rare. Loud speech can't be heard and only quite loud music makes its way through the walls.Remember when thinking about noise control, that acoustical energy transfers similar to thermal energy. The way a wall works to keep the cold out and the warm in will function similarly for noise control. So, if you were in a house and left the window open all the time, you wouldn't be surprised by high heating bills. The window creates a flanking path for energy transfer. Rather than slowly working through that wall designed to slow thermal transfer, the heat goes right out the window. Flanking paths can ruin the noise control performance of a wall or ceiling assembly as well.The construction of every wall and ceiling/floor assembly, then, should strive to avoid flanking paths for both noise and heat. The following flanking paths and noise/energy leaks should be considered:Through ductwork (especially metal ducts rather than fiberglass duct interiors.Open plenums over wall tops.Poor seal at floor to wall edge or wall to ceiling edge.Electrical outlets (don't place back to back through a wall unless you want sound transfer).Cabinet backs not installed over gypsum wall board.Any chase, light, or opening in the wall or ceiling/floor.Louvered doors.When building walls and ceiling/floor assemblies, always think about thermal and sound transmission. So many call-backs from unhappy customers come from these items. Good Supervisors understand that some extra attention to the details in these areas, often picking up things that aren't clearly shown on architectural drawings, yields a much better project with minimal extra cost or effort.",
  "How Does Noise Control Differ from Sound Absorption?": "So the noise control discussed above concerns keeping our spaces free from the noise pollution of surrounding spaces. The other important topic in acoustics involves clearly hearing the sound you're supposed to hear in a space. An auditorium, or even a large meeting room, should allow everyone in the room to clearly hear the speaker's voice. Rooms that are too reverberant, that echo too much, distort the speaker's voice and make the speech difficult to understand.Walls, ceilings and floors can all absorb sound or reflect sound. Therefore, sound absorption becomes an important measure in construction. The\u00a0 Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) act as the standard measure. An NRC of 0 indicates perfect reflect of sound and an NRC of 1 shows perfect absorption of sound. Some common measures for NRC are:Concrete or painted masonry = .05Carpet = .25Heavy carpet on pad = .50Suspended acoustical ceilings = .50 to .75Fiberglass board 2\" thick = 1.00Some other NRC values for building materials are found athttp://www.nrcratings.com/nrc.htmlAs an interesting aside, acoustical design tends to be a balancing act for most spaces. The less reverberation in a space (which means the more sound absorption on all surfaces) the clearer speech will be heard. On the other hand, more reverberant rooms tend to sound much better for music. Think about the cathedrals in Europe...totally reflective surfaces and wonderfully live musical sound. So for most churches, auditoriums and theaters there must be a balance between speech intelligibility and some reverberation so the room doesn't sound too dead.",

So U = 1/R.Check for flanking and leaks for noise and heat at walls and ceilings/floors.",
  "Why Should Roofing Be Very Important to Me?": "Roof leaks seem to be one of the biggest causes of construction lawsuits. When the Owner of the project you're building moves into their new facility and gets rained on inside, he or she gets upset. So, really focus on getting the roof right on your projects. Understand the basics of the proposed roof system and then pay close attention to how things are actually getting done in the field.Many Construction Supervisors think the roofing subcontractor has complete responsibility for the roofing and water tightness, but that's short sighted thinking. I've had Roofing Contractors go bankrupt, leaving all their workmanship issues as my problem. I've had leak problems around mechanical and electrical roof penetrations in which the responsibility isn't that clear. Finally, even if the Roofing Contractor does do the right thing and try to make repairs, it's more difficult to fix a roof than to do it right the first time and everybody's reputation gets besmirched.So avoid the temptation to think that a first class roof will just happen, or will be someone else's responsibility. Put in the time and effort to understand the details and check to make sure those details are getting correctly installed. I know you're busy...make time for this anyway.",
  "What Should I Know About Sloped (>2:12) Roofing?": "Through most of history, roofs sloped. The roofing materials just wouldn't keep the rain and snow out of the building unless the roof had a significant (say 6:12 or 8:12 or 12:12) slope.Thatched roofs,slate roofs,tile roofsandwood shake roofshave all been used for centuries with great results. More recent history broughtcopper roofs,architectural metal roofsandshingles. I'm not going to explain all the different roof types here, you can find that information easily in the hyperlinks above or lots of other places.        Instead, I'll cover a few critical areas.The main areas to watch during a sloped roof installation are the ridge, the edge and valleys. The ridge (or the peak) of the roof often also works as the best location to vent the underside of the roof. Roofing venting keeps moist air that escapes from the inside of the building from condensing\u00a0 on roof sheathing and causing rot, rust or mold. An effectivevapor barrierat the insulation location also helps prevent rot, rust or mold. So make sure any ridge vents get special attention from the Roofing Contractors. Discuss the details, agree on how the ridge vent will be installed to prevent leaks from blowing rains and from snow/ice build-up.The detail and workmanship at the bottom edge of the roof sometimes causes leaks. Too many times, the roof water doesn't drop off the roof edge and into the gutter (or directly to the ground). Instead, the roof water runs back around the bottom drip edge and then into the building to start the rot, rust or mold process. Make sure this detail gets discussed and properly installed.Finally, valleys need to be installed properly. Of the many effective ways to install valleys, the main problem I've encountered is sloppiness. The agreed upon detail simply doesn't get installed in a workmanlike manner. So vigilance pays off here as well.",
  "What Should I Know About Low Sloped (<2:12) Roofing?": "Low sloped roofs came from modern architecture.Huge factories and warehouses became possible with low sloped roofs. In most cases, the lowest acceptable roof slope is 1/4\" per 12\" (or 2% slope). When I started in construction, 1% roof slopes, or even completely flat roofs, were sometimes used, but those roofs just didn't perform that well over time.Built-up roofing(multiple plies of felt adhered with hot asphalt or other adhesive) has the most history and still get used frequently.EPDMrubber roofs have become tremendously popular in recent decades. More recent popularity has come for thePVC and TPOwhite single ply roofs, that provide energy savings due to the lower air conditioning load of a black roof.Standing seam metal roofsalso get installed on millions of square feet of pre-engineered metal buildings each year.The Construction Supervisor should pay close attention to how the water gets off the low slope roof. It may begutters and downspouts,roof scuppersor interiorroof drains, but all of them leak if not properly detailed and installed. So discuss that portion of the work with the Design Professional and with the installer. Understand what should get done and what actually gets done.You should also understand emergency roof drainage requirements. If the roof uses interior roof drains and one of those drains clogs, what happens? In the past, some roofs have collapsed in this scenario. The water builds up, the roof drain doesn't drain, the roof structure deflects down and allows more water to build up, the extra weight of the additional water on the roof further deflects the roof structure, and this continues till the roof collapses or leaks a boatload of water into the inside of the building. So nobody wants that, right?The solution the Code writers put forth is emergency roof drains. If an interior roof drain clogs, there must be an emergency roof drain that will take roof water away and avoid the roof collapse. The emergency roof drains can be done in a variety of ways, but the common factor must be that roof water can only build up a few inches (less than the allowable roof load) before it drains off the roof. So when you use interior roof drains, always look for the secondary (or emergency) roof drain system and know how it works.",

  "What Should I Know About Siding?": "Cedar wood siding,cement board siding,vinyl siding,aluminum siding, andsteel pre-engineered sidingall have a place in the building construction market. When the siding work begins on site, pay attention. Several siding items just need to be started right and continued to finish for a good siding job. The connection of the siding to the substrate should be understood by the actual installer. As you may know, vinyl siding nailed to a plywood substrate needs to be nailed in such a way that the nail allows the vinyl siding to move in the nailing slot due to temperature expansion and contraction. Don't assume everyone installing vinyl siding will understand this concept without any review.Also, the spacing on the siding panels can dramatically affect the look of the project. As the first few panels are put in place, evaluate how the installers are measuring and fastening. The level of quality won't get better as they go, unless you set the standard of acceptability. Remember, as with everything else in construction, perfection is not a standard we strive for. Clearly set what tolerances will be acceptable. It may be 1/16th of an inch, but make it clear to the installers and the final project will benefit.",
  "What are Waterproofing and Dampproofing?": "Water next tobasement wallstends to find its way through the wall and into the building. Remember concrete and masonry walls are rarely detailed and built to prevent the passage water. Therefore, below grade walls that could have water on the outside should have waterproofing, to prevent water on the inside.Most waterproofing systems use a membrane placed on the outside of the wall. Types of membrane waterproofing systems includebitumen,EPDM,Polymericandliquid applied membranes. Each of these waterproofing systems are proprietary and you need to read through their recommendations to assure proper installation.Dampproofing differs from waterproofing. Dampproofing protects against the \"rising damp,\" which is the first few feet of a masonry wall above grade sucking the moisture up from the exterior soils. The capillary action that can suck the water up into the wall can cause mold, rot and stains from the salts. A dampproofing just above ground level can prevent these problems from the rising damp.",
  "What Should I Know About Roof Specialties and Accessories?": "The more penetrations through the roof, the more likely the roof leaks. Even though that statement seems, and probably is, true, most buildings have a slew of roof penetrations.Roof access hatchesare often code required.Roof curbssupport the roof top HVAC equipment that Owners love putting up there in the \"free real estate\" zone. Variouspipes, vents and chimneysneed to penetrate through the roof.Skylightsare popular. On sloped roofs,snow guardshelp keep the ice and snow from all sliding down and one time and tearing off the gutters and downspouts.The main lesson I've learned about roof specialties involves roof curbs. Since I generally didn't pay much attention to roof curbs, I was surprised years ago when we just couldn't get some roof leaks stopped in a standing seam low slope roof with some large rooftop HVAC units. What I learned was that all roof curbs are not equal, especially when used on standing seam roofs. The roof curbs we used didn't have enough taper on the higher roof edge to assure that the roof water ran around the curb, rather than built up in that location. The problem was worse with some slush on the roof or in driving winds. Standing seam roofs don't do well with any standing water on the roof. So if you need to put roof curbs on a standing seam low slope roof, make sure the curb has enough taper to shed the upstream water.",
  "What Caulking and Sealants are Available and How do They \rWork?": "There are lots of types of caulking and sealants, but I don't think you really need to learn the different products and what they do. I think the most important thing you should know about caulking is that it works in 2D but fails in 3D. I'll explain. As I covered in the General Technical Knowledge, Basic Structural section,expansion and contractioncauses significant movement in larger buildings.Think about a brick wall with a control joint. As the brick expand in warmer weather, the joint gets smaller. Conversely, cold weather makes the brick contract and a wider joint. The occupants of the building don't want the rain blowing in through this movement joint, so we caulk it. The figure below illustrates how the caulk stretches in the 2D sketch, when the caulk only attaches to the brick on either side of the joint. On the other hand, if the caulk also bonds at the bottom of the joint (say to some mortar), then it moves in 3D and often fails, tearing away from the brick and not keeping the wall weather-tight.",

  "What Types of Doors and Frames are Common?": "Hollow Metal doors and frames get specified in many commercial and industrial buildings (probably because the steel holds up better than wood). The website forRepublic Doorillustrates the many options available for hollow metal products. This excellent website will give you more information about hollow metal doors and frames than you should ever need.In recent years, I've been using hollow metal frames with pre-finished wood doors in many buildings. The hollow metal frames provides a durable way to complete the gypsum board openings and the pre-finished wood doors are attractive and economical. TheMohawk Doorsseem to be common. Wood frames, using wood trim boards around a wood jamb and header, are also popular. Wood frames tend to be site built, except forpre-hung wood doors.Aluminum and glass storefront also gets used often in commercial buildings. I've installed moreKawneersystems than any other type, but there are lots of good manufacturers. Be careful to check the shop drawings on storefront, verifying rough opening sizes and the details of the frames. Pay particular attention to the fastener location in the frame and where it will fall in your wall. Many times, particularly in cavity wall construction, fasteners fall in the cavity area and extra blocking is required or the frames need to slide in or out of the opening to catch something on which to connect. This is never a pleasant surprise if it becomes apparent only as installation begins.",
  "What are the Basic Door Designs?": "Though not inclusive, the figure shown here shows most of the common door styles. It's worthwhile to know the names of the various styles (most of them are obvious) because the terms are used frequently.",
  "What Should I Know about Fire Doors?": "Underwriter's Laboratories, Inc.(UL) tests and certifies fire doors.\u00a0 The Building Code requires UL rated fire doors to continue the fire resistance of the adjacent wall. Obviously, the goal of fire rated design assemblies is to prevent the spread of fire in a building.You should know that fire rated doors must latch and be self-closing (either by a door closer or a release from a fire alarm signal). UL fire rated doors will have a stamp or plate that many Building Officials will verify.A 3 hour fire rated assembly wall must have at least a Type A (3 hour) fire rated door. A 2 hour fire rated assembly wall in most cases must have\u00a0 a Type B (1 1/2 hour) fire rated door. A 1 hour fire rated assembly wall in most cases must have\u00a0 a Type C (3/4 hour) fire rated door. The fire rating on the doors must be shown on the drawings, but I include the above so you understand the basics of the system.The allowable amount of glazing (window) in a fire rated door also gets discussed often in the field. Many Owners want to make changes in the door glazing during construction. So you should know the rules of thumb on fire door glazing. 3 hour fire doors can't have glazing, 1 1/2 hour fire doors can have a maximum of 100 square inches of glazing and 3/4 hour fire doors can have a maximum of 1,296 square inches of glazing. Again, there are code variations for certain circumstances, but these are the normal case rules of thumb.",
  "What Should I Know about Overhead and Coiling Doors?": "Overhead Doors can be used for dock doors, drive-in doors or just for large temporary openings in interior walls. The sectional overhead door is the most common type, though the rolling steel service doors also are common. The website forOverhead Doorsprovides good information about the various options. As in all door and window construction, you must have a well built opening for a quality door installation.When thinking about overhead door installations, always consider the door operator. If it's an electric operator, make sure the proper coordination happens with the Electrical Contractor and the Door Supplier. This is an area that often gets worked out only at the installation stage, and then rather inefficiently. As an added value to the Project end user, you should also think how the electric operators will really get used in the life of the building. So many times the push button switches get placed in poor operational locations...or the wireless transmitter on a forklift really is the best way to open the door. So you can add value to the entire project if you think to ask these questions.The weather stripping detail on overhead doors should always be well-considered, as it's easy to just let this happen. Even the sill detail, often a concrete detail, matters dramatically if it doesn't have enough slope away from the building and leaks in blowing rain water.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Doors:": "Have the same person set the door frame and hang the door, when possible.Make sure door and window fasteners hit solid material, particularly in cavity wall construction.Ask how overhead door operators would ideally be controlled, rather than just locating switches wherever.A 3 hour fire rated assembly wall needs a Type A (3 hour) fire rated door. A 2 hour fire wall needs a Type B (1 1/2 hour) fire rated door. A 1 hour wall needs a Type C (3/4 hour) fire rated door. Be wary of Code variations.3 hour fire doors can't have glazing, 1 1/2 hour fire doors can have a maximum of 100 square inches of glazing and 3/4 hour fire doors can have a maximum of 1,296 square inches of glazing. Be wary of Code variations.",
  "What Types of Windows are Common?": "Wood windows still get used in many commercial and multi-family residential buildings.Anderson Windowsget used in many applications, as doPella Windows, and both have websites that fully explain their products.Vinyl windows have become increasingly popular due to the cost effectiveness. I've often usedSimontonvinyl windows over the years and have been consistently happy with their performance.While I don't think I've ever installed factory built aluminum windows, I understand they are popular in some regions. TheColumbia Windows and Doorswebsite provides helpful specifics.On the other hand, I've done most of my projects using some type of site built aluminum and glass windows. These commercial storefront type windows are built on site using the manufacturer's extruded aluminum shapes and then site glazed. I've installed moreKawneersystems than any other type, but there are lots of good manufacturers.",
  "What are the Basic Window Designs?": "The following basic window designs are often used and should be known by a Construction Supervisor:Double Hung: both sash open fully, sliding vertically.Single Hung: top sash stays fixed, bottom sash opens fully, sliding vertically.Double Slider: both sash open fully, sliding horizontally.Single Slider: one sash stays fixed, other sash opens fully, sliding horizontally.Casement: sash hinged on the side and cranks open to perpendicular to the wall.Awning: sash hinged on the top and cranks out and up to perpendicular to the wall.Picture: fixed window that does not open.Bay or Bow: combined fixed windows that project outward from the wall.Patio Door: a sliding full glass door.Garden Door: a swinging full glass door.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Windows:": "Make sure window foaming to air seal the edges doesn't expand and bind the window operation.Flash factory built windows exactly as manufacturer recommends.Decide on each project if you will guarantee the window opening sizes or have them field measured (so windows will be built to fit the openings).",
  "What are the Common Types of Builder's Hardware?": "Getting builder's hardware right will matter to the Owner at occupancy and for the life of the facility. Builder's hardware gets touched and used often, so when it doesn't work quite right (or completely fails) it's a big deal. Here are the common types of builder's hardware:Door hinges: For some odd reason, door hinges are typically measured in pairs of hinges. So a door with 3 hinges gets noted as 1 1/2 pairs of hinges. The typical door hinges are plain bearing butt hinges, ball bearing butt hinges, spring hinges (self closing), pivot hinges (located at the top and bottom of the door) and piano hinges (continuous). The Builder's Hardware Manufacturer's Association also provides some useful information onhinges.Door locksets and latchsets: With the adoption of the American Disabilities Act (ADA) door knobs have almost become relics, as ADA requires door levels which can be opened with a fist. Pay attention to the many different lockset styles: privacy locksets for toilet rooms, storage locksets that always lock and open only with a key, office locksets that have a push button lock for locking while remaining in the room, and the many other possibilities. It's good to ask the end building user to verify that the functions of the locksets really do accomplish what he or she needs. The Builder's Hardware Manufacturer's Association also provides some useful information ontypes of locks.Door closers: as the name states, door closers close doors. Fire doors require door closers. In many other situations, door closers simply improve how the building functions. Door closers are available as surface mounted or concealed closers. Hold open function on the door closer, while not available for fire doors, is often a useful feature. It's good to ask the end building user if door closer hold-opens are desired. The Builder's Hardware Manufacturer's Association also provides some useful information ondoor closers.Panic hardware exit devices: The Code often requires panic hardware for doors in which the occupants need only push into the door device to exit. Prior to receiving panic hardware, determine how it will be operable from the exterior (lever, thumb-piece, dummy trim, etc.) Many Owner's are disappointed to find they need to \"dog down\" the panic hardware with an Allen wrench every day to keep it operable from the outside. The Builder's Hardware Manufacturer's Association also provides some useful information onexit devices.There are many more kinds of builder's hardware which you'll work with over the years. Try to spend some extra time learning about what you are to install on each project and discuss with the building end user, if possible. You will greatly improve your perceived value to the project and help them get what will actually work best for them. In short, learn to see this tricky area as an opportunity for you.",

  "What Types of Glass are Commonly Available?": "The Romans used some glass windows, but glass really came into wide use with the stained windows in cathedrals of the Middle Ages and beyond. The following types of glass are common in buildings:Float glass: the most common type of glass used in windows, not a safety glass, will break into large, dangerous pieces.Heat strengthened (tempered) glass: a type of safety glass that breaks into many small pieces, can have imbedded wire also.Laminated glass: a type of safety glass that breaks but stays together as a unit.",
  "What are the Various Energy Saving Options for Glass?": "The windows tend to lose lots of energy for most buildings. A typical building wall may have anR valueof 20, while a windowR valuewill be less than 1. So there have been many recent improvements in window technology for improved energy conservation:Low e glass: low emissivity (low e) glass uses a thin coating on the inside of the window glass to increase R value by reducing radiant heat flow. These coatings are transparent to visible light and opaque to infrared light. On a typical double glazed insulated glass, the low e coating is on the inside faces of the glass.Krypton gas fill: the air typically found in an insulated glass unit is replaced with Krypton gas, which is 12 times more dense than air and provides additional insulation value.Tinted glass: since much of the energy use in commercial buildings is often for air conditioning, tinted glass reduces the ultraviolet and visible light that comes into the building interior, thus reducing the heat load.",

  "What is Gypsum Board?": "Gypsum Board is also called Drywall, Gyp Board, Rock Lath or Sheetrock. With paper on both sides and a gypsum plaster center, the gypsum board product gained popularity because of ease of installation, compared to plastering. Skilled drywall mechanics achieve\u00a0 reasonably plumb, square and true walls quickly.The traditional gypsum board panel size was 4' x 8'. But many more options are now readily available. Lengths of 10' and 12' are now common, as are 4' - 6\" width, which are used for 9' - 0\" ceiling heights. Type X gypsum board varies from regular gypsum board because Type X has noncombustible fibers added to the gypsum to improve fire resistance.The tapered edges along the length of the gypsum board allows drywall finishing compound to be placed without creating much of a raised surface between the adjacent boards. Due to these tapered edges, a more true (or straight) wall can be built. Since the ends of gypsum board are not tapered but are square, it's desirable to eliminate end butt joints when possible. When building rooms with dimensions 12' or smaller, gypsum board can be hung horizontally (4' wide boards for an 8' ceiling height and 4' - 6\" wide boards for a 9' ceiling height) with the appropriate length board to not have any butt joints. Even in larger rooms, hanging the gypsum board horizontally has become more popular, because the butt joints can be staggered, which seems to create less of a visibly noticeable joint.",
  "Why So Many Problems with Gypsum Board Finishing?": "Over the years, I've had many discussions and problems with the quality of gypsum board joints. Often a wall looks good with the gypsum board hung and the 3 coats of joint compound applied, sanded and wet sponged. Later in the construction project, that wall will look poor with a semi-gloss paint and direct lighting which illuminates all the imperfections. When standing with an Owner, looking at a finished wall and clearly seeing all the joint locations, it's difficult to defend the quality of the work. Here are a few things I've learned:Discuss how the gypsum board will be hung prior to the Drywall Contractor even stocking the job, agree on where the challenging areas will be for quality control.A window at the end of a long corridor or lights near the edge of the ceiling that wash down over the wall both highly accent any drywall finishing joints. So if you can't avoid those light conditions, make the Drywall Finisher aware of how the lighting will occur. Also, make the Owner aware that these lighting conditions tend to make gypsum board walls look bad.Prior to painting the wall, require the drywall finisher to take a bright portable light and check the entire wall for finish quality. When in doubt, add another layer of joint compound and widen the joint.Try to avoid the use of semi-gloss paint, use a washable flat or a scrubable flat paint. If the Owner or Designer insists on a semi-gloss, clearly explain to them\u00a0 that they may have to live with the appearance of more pronounced drywall joints.The effect of the type of paint and lighting conditions has caused so many issues over the years that the Gypsum Association producedGA-214-96 Recommended Levels of Gypsum Board Finishthat defines various levels of work for the drywall finisher. The normal three coat finish is called a Type 4 finish. They also define a Type 5 finish for harsh lighting conditions or glossier paints, in which the entire board is coated with a final 1/8\" of joint compound to create a truly flat surface.As in so many other areas, the excellent Construction Supervisor anticipates the problems that may occur with drywall finishing and addresses them with the Owner and Drywall Contractor prior to the start of the work.",
  "Why Recycle Gypsum Board?": "In the past few years, we've been recycling the gypsum board on some of our projects. Probably 15 to 20% of gypsum board ends up as scrap on a normal construction project. This scrap typically gets put in the dumpster and hauled to the landfill. We've found that for about the same cost, we can keep all the gypsum board scrap in a separate pile and have a drywall recycler come and pick-up the material. While this takes a bit more effort to coordinate, it seems to be the right thing to do. Also, this construction waste recycling helps the project be defined as a \"Green Building Project\".",
  "What is Plaster?": "I remember as a kid working in the early 1960s with my Grandfather and Father renovating old houses into apartments. My Grandfather would show me the horse hair plaster on the walls. I could see the hair fibers in the walls; the original builders had added the hair to the plaster to increase the tension strength for durability. The plaster had been applied to wood laths, about 3/8\" thick x 1 1/2\" wide spaced with a small gap to the next lath.Historically, Plaster of Paris was from a large gypsum deposit found in the Montmartre district of Paris. The name was shortened to plaster. Where I live, there aren't any gypsum deposits, but there is plenty of limestone. So years ago there were lime kilns that burned the limestone and created quicklime, that was sold as a plaster product to build interior walls.These days, gypsum plaster or cement plaster still get used occasionally on construction projects (though gypsum board gets used far more often due to speed of installation). Plaster projects often are placed over a steel mesh lath that is fastened to the wall or ceiling. The normal plaster project includes a scratch coat, a brown coat and a finish coat.",
  "How does Sound Transmission Work and Why are Resilient Channels so Amazing?": "Building occupants often care deeply about how much sound gets through their walls or floor/ceilings. So the building industry developed a Sound Transmission Coefficient (STC) rating system. If the sound level in one room is 70 decibels and 20 decibels gets over to the adjoining room, that would be a STC of 50. So the amount of decibel level decrease from one space to the next is the STC rating. The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that an increase in 10 decibels will sound twice as loud. An increase of 20 decibels will sound four times as loud. Here are some common decibel levels:Weakest sound able to be heard\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0 decibels (dB)Rustle of leaves\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10 dBQuiet whisper in a Library\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30 dBAverage office noise level\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 50 dBNormal conversation at 3'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 60 dB to 70 dBNormal piano practice\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 60 dB to 70 dBTruck traffic\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 90 dBPeople shouting\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 90 dBGas lawnmower at 3'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100 dBElectric circular saw at 3'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 110 dBLoud rock concert\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 110 dB to 120 dBJet engine at 100'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 140 dBLoudest sound possible\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 194 dBSo a 2 x 4 wood stud wall with 1/2 gypsum board on either side has a STC of 35. In apartment buildings, these are called \"paper thin walls\". Adding fiberglass batt insulation raises the STC to 39. Just adding resilient channels to the one side of the studs jumps the STC to 46 (the equivalent of a 2' thick concrete wall). Additional layers of gypsum board can further increase the STC to over 60.The secret to this excellent sound reduction has to do with decoupling the two wall faces. If the sound energy on the sound source side of the wall is used in vibrating the one wall face, rather than just vibrating through the whole wall and into the next room, then the noise doesn't get transferred. The resilient channel works like a spring in a car, creating vibration isolation. Neither a hat channel nor a zee channel creates this same dampening effect.The following linkhttp://www.ta-inc.com/newshtml/rc.htmhas an excellent further explanation about sound transmission and resilient channels.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Finishes Basics:": "Resolve gypsum board butt joints prior to the board being delivered to the job.Resolve gypsum board stocking locations prior to the board being delivered to the job.Discuss wall lighting and glossiness of paint with the Owner in regard to drywall finishing.Consider a gypsum board scrap recycling program.When building walls and ceilings, always think about fire, sound and heat transmission.When installing resilient channels, make sure the screws through the drywall don't go into the studs.",
  "What Should I Know about Painting and Wall Coverings?": "The Painting and Flooring Contractors often get the dirty end of the stick when it comes to scheduling. On many projects, delays during the course of the sitework and shell construction happen, but the completion date doesn't change. So the Painting and Flooring Contractors often have to complete their work in compressed time. In addition to the less time to do their work, they\u00a0 often have lots more people around, electricians, carpenters, etc, getting in their way.I've learned over the years that those type of project completions take a toll on the final project quality. We all need to understand that the Painting Contractor isn't going to get a high quality wall finish if a carpenter is cutting wood trim nearby. Even though none of us plan to compress the schedule for the finishes, it happens routinely. At the least we should all, including the Owner, be aware of the quality costs. Hopefully, though, we can do better and actually schedule adequate time and unobstructed space for the Finish Contractors to get their work do with high quality.There are many paint and coating options available, though I don't think the Construction Supervisor really needs to become expert in the options available. One of the largest paint suppliers isICI, which has an informative website. A couple of other quality tips:For a higher quality paint job, make sure they pole sand between coats to remove imperfections in the finish.Use the proper nap rollers for the type of paint to be used.The wall finish under vinyl wall coverings needs to be almost as good as a paint grade finish (imperfections will show through).",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Painting:": "Give the Painting Contractor adequate time and space to get the job done with high quality.",
  "What Should I Know about Ceilings?": "As a finish surface, the ceilings influence the final look of the project. So many options are available to Architects and Designers that I'll just list a few excellent web sites here.TheUS Gypsum Design Studiosite provides a tremendous amount of useful information about ceiling options as well as gypsum board suspension systems and wall systems. The tutorials provided on the site are impressive.TheArmstrongsite also provides lots of great information about ceilings and suspension systems. This site has one of the coolest features I've ever seen...anInteractive Reverberation Tool. This Tool allows you to hear the differences in reverberation for a room and allows you to vary the surface materials, or the room size, and learn immediately the change. For example, we were renovating a 140' x 140' gymnasium last year. The Owner was concerned with the acoustics (how reverberant the room would be), but we just sort of built it and it was what it was.With this Tool, you can try out various options and actually hear the difference. Imagine yourself talking with the Project Owner as she worries over how bad the acoustics might be in the auditorium. Then you tell her about this website, maybe even show her how it works and what some changes would sound like. You go from being just another Construction Supervisor to an amazingly valuable and memorable resource. That's when Learning Leads to Advancement.The last site I'm listing here specializes intin ceilings. While I haven't done any of these, I'm seeing them around more and it seems like a comprehensive site.",

  "What Should I Know about Flooring?": "Usually the last of the trades to complete, the flooring gets seen first by visitors to the project. Like the other finish trades, if the substrate under the finish material is done poorly, the finish material will reflect that. So the time to get the flooring (or the painting) right is way before the Flooring Contractor gets on site. But those Concrete and Carpentry Trades are covered elsewhere in this site.There are so many flooring options, I'll just cover a few of them here. Carpet products and options get explained well in thisShaw Floorswebsite.\u00a0Vinyl sheet flooring and Vinyl Composition Tile (VCT) are prominently displayed in thisArmstrong Flooringwebsite. Ceramic tile can add great beauty to a project and the Conestoga Tile website shows lots of useful information. The FAQs provide ceramic tile basics that you should know.TheA-1 Wood Flooringwebsite provides information on all types of wood flooring products as well as tips and resources. On the industrial side, seamless epoxy floors are described in theFlorockwebsite. Terrazzo floors, often used in institutional settings, are described in theNational Terrazzo and Mosaic Flooring Associationwebsite.",
  "What Should I Know about Carpeting?": "First, thinkfiber.Nylon carpeting is durable, stain resistant and repels mildew. It holds color well, though prone to staining if not given a stain-blocking treatment. The vast majority of residential carpeting is nylon.Olefin (or polypropylene) lacks the soft feel of nylon that homeowners love, but is strong, stain and mildew resistant and inexpensive. Olefin is a popular choice for commercial applications.Polyester carpeting can be actually softer than similarly priced nylon. Sometimes made from recycled plastic bottles, the cost and green aspects are great. The fiber is prone to crushing, though, so there are wear concerns.PET or PTT carpets are a sub-class of polyester and gaining tremendous market share. They can be as durable as nylon, but softer, better stain resistance and lower cost. Over the last several years,\u00a0\u00a0the multi-family residential market is moving more towards PET or PTT carpeting.Wool carpets are both luxurious and naturally stain resistant, though the very high price eliminates wool from most discussions.Within atype of fiber, it's fairly easy to compare one carpet option to another. Simply put, the more dense the carpet (in oz per sy) and the higher the twist level (in turns per inch),\u00a0the more durable. After you understand the fiber, think about thestyle. Carpet is made with the fiber looping into the backing. Loop carpets retain those loops and cut piles slice them.Texture carpet is a cut pile.Frieze carpet is a cut pile with a tight twist in the fiber.Berbercarpet is a tight loop that offers great durability, usually without patterns, named from the Berber people of North Africa who made carpets with knots that resemble the tight loops. Berbers are mostly used in commercial, high traffic areas.Loop carpet tends to be a lower cost option with less aesthetic options.Pattern carpet can have fiber depth patterns or fiber color patterns.No rational method currently exists to compare the various fibers and styles. As stated earlier, comparing within a fiber group can be done based on density and twist level. But there is no good method to compare 24 oz/sy nylon carpet to a 26 oz/sy PET. So the comparing of carpet options, particularly when approving \"Or Equal\" products remains subjective and challenging.The carpet padding, used in most residential applications for a more cushioned feel, should be at least 6 lbs/cf. Most commercial carpet installations are glued directly to the concrete floor.If you are trying tovalue engineera building project, understand that substantial savings can be made by approaching the carpet selection from an informed viewpoint. It's\u00a0definitely\u00a0not a situation where \"The more you pay, the better you get.\"",

  "What Should I Know about Pre-Engineered Building Systems?": "I've helped build many pre-engineered buildings (often called metal building systems) over the years, from warehouses to air plane hangers to recreation centers. I like the efficiency of the pre-engineered systems, but have learned several lessons the hard way. To begin, let's define a pre-engineered building. If it's a steel frame building and the steel columns and beams get designed by the building manufacturer, such asButler Manufacturing,American Buildings,Ceco Building Systems, orMetallic Buildings, then it's a pre-engineered building. On the other hand, if a consulting structural engineer designs the steel beams and columns, usingrolled steel sections, then it's a conventional steel building.The sketch below from the Navy Builder's Training Manual shows a simple illustration of a pre-engineered steel building.Pre-engineered buildings can be built for lower cost because of the system approach:Designed with complicated computer software that focuses on efficiency (individual Structural Engineers tend to add a \"Fudge Factor\" onto calculations to be more conservative and protect themselves).Factory produced with lower cost (less skilled) labor than steel job shops.Shipping weight carefully considered, even to trimming down unneeded steel on sections to reduce shipping costs.Roof and siding installed by the same trade, creating another efficiency on the job site.Single source responsibility and coordination.Quick erection in the field because of the system approach.For the Construction Supervisor, one of the advantages of pre-engineered systems can also be a big problem. Since the structural design is so efficient, the capacity for the beams and columns to carry extra loads is minimal. In a conventional steel building, a rooftop unit or a monorail crane gets added and the extra capacity in the steel design usually covers the extra load. You need to be much more careful with pre-engineered building changes. Don't assume any added structural load will be acceptable. Make sure the pre-engineered building manufacturer knows about the proposed changes and approves them.Along that same line of thinking, the Construction Supervisor should know the design loading used on a pre-engineered building. A knowledge ofbasic structural designhelps prevent big and small problems. I also recommend a review of the selected building manufacturer's website. It helps you get familiar with their products and procedures.The steel purlins that get used on the roof and the steel girts that get used on the walls are made from cold formed steel framing (different from the hot rolled structural steel). The cold forming process passes steel sheets between large rollers to deform the steel, but at a lower temperature than hot rolling. The rolling process compresses and stretches the steel, hardening it in the process. Most cold rolled steel is either 33,000 psi or 50,000 psi yield strength.The sizes and attributes for girts and purlins are shown athttp://www.loseke.com/lgsi.html(which has all the technical information available about cold formed steel framing). At the site listed above, you can scroll down the left menu to find the properties of C sections and Z sections.My general caution for Construction Supervisors working on pre-engineered buildings: understand that the cost efficiency comes with a cost. The pre-engineered buildings have less tolerance for changes or errors than conventional buildings. For example, the water-tightness of the building often has only one level of protection, if those details aren't completed correctly, leaks occur. Conventional construction often provides flashings and counter flashings that catch water that leaks past a first layer. So you must understand how the pre-engineered system is designed to work and pay attention that it gets installed correctly.",
  "What Should I Know about Swimming Pools?": "Swimming pool contractors generally handle the hydraulic design, flow rates, pumps, filters, and chemical management systems. They also know what they need for excavation, concrete, rebar and grounding.

Of course, the goal is to build pools that stay clean and sanitized.",

  "What Should I Know about Elevators?": "The two basic categories of elevators arehydraulicelevators andcable (also called traction)elevators. Within the first category there areholeless hydraulicandbore hole hydraulic. The hydraulic elevators\u00a0 provide an economical option for low rise buildings. The second type        elevator is for mid or high rise buildings and utilizes a cable system.The Construction Supervisor should pay attention to the actual requirements for the elevator shaft and the machine room. Often the information shown on bid drawings doesn't match the true requirements for the purchased elevator, so the Construction Supervisor should verify the following:Actual required elevator shaft inside dimensions?Requirement and size of sump pit?Requirement and size and discharge of sump pump?Is an oil detection system required on the sump pump discharge?Where do the rail attachment inserts get located?Is there adequate rail attachment at the top of the elevator shaft?",
  "What Should be Done before the Elevator Contractor Arrives?": "Of course, a Construction Supervisor should be prepared for any new trade that starts on the project. The reality, though, is that we often aren't as prepared as we should be. Often the newest trade comes onto the project and we fit them in as we go. It's not ideal, but it's reality.Try not to let that happen with the Elevator Contractor. If they come onto the site prior to them being able to efficiently work, problems and costs tend to pile up. A couple of basic things that you should remember:If 3 phase power isn't available at the elevator, they can't start.If the elevator shaft isn't dry, you won't get an occupancy permit, so get it dry before they start (it's easier than later).Make sure they can unload their truck and store their hundreds of pieces and parts near the shaft.Those are a few of the basics.

  "What are the Basics of Rigging?": "To pay my way through college, I worked as a roadie in the rock and roll business. On the Bruce Springsteen 1978 tour I also worked as the ground man for the rigger. He'd climb up on the roof beams and girders, dropping me a rope. I'd tie a knot connecting the rope to cable harnesses and then to a chain hoist. Then the rigger would pull up the cables and chain, connecting them to the beams. The chain climbing 2 ton hoists would then lift our speakers and amplifiers 20 to 30 feet into the air.I vividly recall the first time I had to climb down that 30 feet, trusting a knot I'd recently learned to tie. As I slipped off the edge of the hanging platform I thought, \"I'm trusting my life to that knot I just tied.\" I loved learning the basics of knots and rigging.The Canadian Sea Cadets have an excellent training course forpractical knotsand thebasics of rigging. I encourage you to learn these helpful skills, you'll use them in other areas of your life. It's just nice to be competent in practical matters. TheGeneral Technical Knowledgearea of this website provides an even deeper understanding ofsimple machines.",
  "What Should I Know about Hoists and Cranes?": "Many industrial buildings need hoists to lift materials in the manufacturing or assembly process.         A hoist lifts or lowers a load by wrapping the drum or wheel with chain, wire rope or rope. There aremanual hoists,electric hoistsandair powered hoists. Hoists normally lift loads vertically from one location (providing one dimensional, up-down type movement).Cranes, on the other hand, have the ability to move the hoist so the load can be lifted vertically and moved horizontally. Ajib cranehas a horizontal member that connects to a wall or vertical column. The hoist is mounted on that horizontal member. The horizontal member may also swing to provide additional lateral movement of the load. Agantry cranehas a hoist mounted on a trolley. The trolley and hoist move horizontally on a beam, able to lift a load and move laterally (providing two dimensional movement).Traveling building cranesallow a load to be lifted and moved in three dimensional space. The gantry crane (a hoist with a trolley on a beam) gets mounted on another set of trolleys which allow the gantry crane to move in the other direction. The traveling cranes allow the most flexibility for lifting and moving loads.",
  "What Three Things Must the Plumber Know?": "Hot's on left, cold's on right and shinola runs downhill.",
  "It Runs Downhill...But What Then? (a Primer on Sanitary \rSewers)": "The Plumber should be one of the heroes of modern society. In the 19th century, people moved closer together for work in Industrial Revolution jobs. Typhoid, cholera and dysentery killed thousands due to issues of human waste. Modern plumbing methods, and our Hero the Plumber, helped eliminate this means of spreading infectious diseases. Look at societies today with poor sanitary sewer systems and you'll see a high infant mortality rate and a low longevity.Building Codes recognize this connection between adequately designed and installed sanitary plumbing systems and the public health. To design sanitary systems, most Codes rely on a clever concept called Drainage Fixture Units (DFUs). By setting a DFU quantity for each type of plumbing fixture, the Code considers both how much water a fixture typically passes and the probability of how often the fixtures will be used. In a four story office building with a common toilet rooms on each floor, for example, all the toilets, lavatories, urinals and sinks won't get used at the same moment. If plumbing systems had to be designed for that scenario, pipe sizes would be huge.The DFU concept allows reasonable sizing of sanitary sewer lines, based on experience from many buildings. Of course, the Plumbing Engineer may decide to design more conservatively than the DFU requirements. A football stadium, where all the beer gets drained from bladders during halftime, needs to be designed for all fixtures to flow at one time. Generally, though, the DFU concept gets used often and the basics should be understood by the Construction Supervisor.The US Army Field Manual for Plumbing has some helpful guidelines below:A general understanding of the DFU design process helps the Construction Supervisor understand the importance of the sanitary sewer pipe size and slope. If you'd like a more detailed understanding of the Plumbing Trade, review the public domain documents below.\u00a0 The basics of a plumbing drain system, though, are shown in the graphic below.",
  "Why are Vents Important?": "Sewer gas stinks and can make people sick. Maybe not tough guys like you and I, but other people. So plumbing traps prevent the sewer gas from getting up into the inhabited space. The trap keeps that sewer gas down in the pipes where the sewer flows. The details below illustrate:The concept of the trap seal seems reasonable...keep a water plug between the smelly sewer gas and us. The figure above, though, shows that trap seal being lost as water runs through. That figure shows us why we vent sewer pipes. We need to protect the trap seal. For water to flow, air must replace the volume of water that flows away (think of a straw in a soda with your thumb covering the top of the straw). Since sewer pipes don't run completely full, like that straw full of Coke, the pipe will flow by getting some air over the top of the flowing liquid. But we occasionally lose the trap seal if the flow of water almost fills the pipe. Therefore, vents must be designed and installed so air can get to that trap, protecting the trap water from flowing down the drain and exposing us to sewer gas.The most common venting is an individual vent, which is commonly required to be at least half the pipe size of the fixture being vented but not less than 1 1/4\". Venting complications abound, with common venting, wet venting, waste stack venting, circuit venting, combination drain and vent and island fixture venting. To understand the rules for those vents, you need to consult the Code for your jurisdiction. A simple graphic showing drains and vents is shown below:A wonderful website,ThePlumber.com, provides some great venting details and professional advice if you want to better understand vents.",
  "Why Start with the Fixtures?": "When you start a project and begin to understand the plumbing, I recommend you start by thinking about the fixtures. Many of us have the tendency to get right into the details. We wonder, \"What is the depth of that sewer line? Do any other pipes interfere with the run? Can the slope change to make it work?\" Instead, we should begin at the beginning.The sewer lines and the water lines are in the project to serve the plumbing fixtures (which are there to serve the occupants). So begin the project by carefully reviewing the fixtures. Understand what types are selected and how they work. Let's go through a brief review:Toilets (also called water closets): Toilets carry organic body wastes to the sewer and are made from vitreous china. The main classification for toilets are floor mounted vs. wall hung and tank type vs. flush valve. Toilets have the trap built into the toilet fixture, so the sanitary sewer piping for toilets doesn't include a trap. Here are some toilet options from theUS Army Field Manual on Plumbing(which provides much more detailed information and repair instructions) :If you want to learn lots more about toilets, and anything else to do with actually doing plumbing work, go toThePlumber.com.Next to the toilet, you will hopefully find a lavatory, a place to wash your hands after doing the dirty deed. Lavatories may be vitreous china, enameled cast iron, stainless steel or plastic and be wall mounted, pedestal or surface mounted into a vanity cabinet. Here are some lavatory options from theUS Army Field Manual on Plumbing(which provides much more detailed information and repair instructions) :Sinks also allow you to wash your hands, but the sink classification is broader and includes kitchen sinks, mop sinks, slop sinks, bar sinks, etc.Here are some sink options from theUS Army Field Manual on Plumbing.Urinals are also described in theUS Army Field Manual on Plumbingand shown below.Other plumbing fixtures include showers, bathtubs, water fountains, bidets, whirlpools, and garbage disposals. An internet search on any of these items will provide more specific information.",
  "What Should I Know about Pipe?": "Most plumbing codes have lots of information on pipe and allow all sorts of pipe options you'll probably never see. Cast iron pipe, for example, gets included in almost every plumbing code, but I haven't seen any cast iron pipe installed for quite a while. All sorts of high tech pipe types also are approved which never get used in normal buildings. So between the old and the new, lots of pipe options makes for confusing codes.Let's try to cover the pipe basics that you'll likely see on a jobsite. Sanitary sewers inside buildings most often get built from PVC schedule 40 pipe, while sewers outside buildings often use PVC SDR-35 pipe. PVC schedule 40 pipe uses glued connections while PVC SDR-35 has gasketed-joint, slip-in connections.

These pipes normally come in 10' and 20' sections. Schedule 40 pipe gets used most often, followed by the heavier schedule 80, then the even heavier duty schedule 120.The term SDR stands for \"Standard Dimension Ratio\", it's the ratio of pipe diameter to wall thickness. Therefore, all SDR-35 pipe sizes will have the same maximum water pressure. Also the higher the SDR, the more thin the pipe wall is compared to the diameter. Finally, the standard lengths for SDR pipes are 14' and 20'.PVC SDR-35 pipeNominal Pipe SizeInside Diameter (I.D.)Outside Diameter (O.D.)Wall ThicknessWeight per FootMaximum Water Pressureinchinchinchinchpoundpsi4\"3.984.22.121.031206\"5.876.23.182.291208\"7.928.4.244.0512010\"9.910.5.306.3512012\"11.7812.5.369.05120PVC SDR-26 pipeNominal Pipe SizeInside Diameter (I.D.)Outside Diameter (O.D.)Wall ThicknessWeight per FootMaximum Water Pressureinchinchinchinchpoundpsi4\"3.94.22.161.571606\"5.756.23.243.411608\"7.768.4.325.7816010\"9.710.5.408.9716012\"11.5412.5.4812.62160Water piping has more common options. I almost never see galvanized iron pipe installed anymore, though it was common years ago. Both cost and problems with long term corrosion and maintenance have forced the decline. Copper tubing, on the other hand, continues to be popular, even with the large price increases in recent years. Of the three wall thicknesses for copper tubing, I've never used the most thin, Type M copper. The most common Type L copper gets used often for water distribution systems (i.e. piping from the water meter or exterior building wall to the plumbing fixtures). Type K copper has the thickest walls and gets used more for water service (i.e. from the water main to the meter or the exterior building wall). Copper tubing also can be rigid (the straight sections) or soft (rolls).ThePlumber.comprovides an excellent discussion on water piping and extols the virtues of copper tubing.PVC pipe and CPVC(for hot water) pipe also get used often, but have a tendency to leak sooner than copper.PEX pipingsystems (PEX stands for polyethylene cross linked) have become extremely popular in recent years. The PEX systems are simple and inexpensive to install and rarely leak. The main downside is that the flexible piping, when installed in exposed locations, doesn't look as neat and workmanlike as straight pipe. One important thing to remember with PEX tubing, though, is that it deteriorates rapidly when exposed to UV light. So PEX tubing must be kept out of any sunlight.",
  "What are the Basics of Sizing a Water System?": "If you've ever taken a shower and heard a toilet flush, you begin to understand that water system design is tricky. Do you know what happened when you got scalded in the shower? The toilet flush demanded a water flow of cold water only (unless you flush your toilet with hot water) which dropped the pressure in the cold water part of the water distribution system. As the pressure drops, the flow drops. On the hot water side, though, no flush, no pressure drop, no change in flow. So in the shower you get the same amount of hot water and less cold water...and that's not good.A well designed water system reduces this effect. When the pipes are sized correctly for the likely flows, the pressure drops of another use has a smaller effect. Of course, most plumbing Codes further protect the person in the shower by now requiring a temperature actuated mixing valve at the shower that prevents scalding.Water system design, then, must account for water flows (in gallons per minute), pressure drop from friction in pipes and from elevation changes (in psi) and water velocity (in feet per minute). These varying factors, along with never knowing which combination of plumbing fixtures will require water at the same time makes the water system design complicated.Similar to sewer design discussed above, the concept of the water service fixture unit (WSFU) helps simplify the process. The Code lists WSFUs for cold water, hot water and total water for each type of plumbing fixture. Then the design water flow in gpm can be found for any section of piping in the system. Awater flow chartthen shows the pipe size and friction loss options. This section explains the theory, but doesn't give enough information to actually do the design. Go to your Plumbing Code if you want to understand more.Another basic concept you should understand about water systems is the pressure loss with height. I recommend you memorize that one psi equals about 2 feet of height gain. So a 50' raise from the ground floor to the 4th floor will drop the water pressure by 25psi. If your public water system provides 45 psi at street level, you will have 20 psi at the 4th floor. Since 20 psi is about the minimum water pressure often recommended, this would work. If the building proposed is an 8 story, what happens? We have a 100' rise, which gives about a 50psi pressure drop. Since we are only starting with 45 psi, we won't be getting any water up to the 8th floor. Thus we'd need a booster pump.The US Army Field Manual 3-34.471 shows a worked example ofwater system designand several helpful graphs.",

  "How Can I Begin to Understand HVAC Systems?": "The heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems drive occupant comfort in buildings. HVAC systems control the air temperature, of course, but also to intake outside air, exhaust or filter contaminated air and efficiently use energy. Since HVAC systems are complicated, many Construction Supervisors don't bother to learn about them. That's a mistake. Most of the occupant complaints about the buildings we build involve HVAC systems, so we should all be paying more attention to how these systems get designed and installed.If you take the time to understand the basics of HVAC systems, you'll discover valuable knowledge that you'll use on every project. Start by watching these well done training videos by Price which show theBasics of HVAC.Another excellent Price training video isComfort Criteria, which explains how occupants actually experience the HVAC system in action.",
  "What are the Basic Types of HVAC Systems?": "Whenever you consider an HVAC system, begin with a few basic questions.What is the fuel used for heating? Gas, oil, coal, electricity, etc.What is the type of cooling? Electric heat pump, electric air conditioner, chiller, gas air conditioner, etc.How is the heat or cooling delivered to the occupant space? Hot and cold ducted air system, hot and cold water system (hydronic or steam), radiant heat system, etc.What is the ventilation? Summer ventilation with intake louvers and fans, supply and return air with outside air introduced for ventilation, dedicated ventilation system, etc.Unfortunately, answering the questions above doesn't lead you right into understanding the HVAC system because of the many options. Answering the questions above puts you on the right track for beginning to understand the system, though. The next step is to know about a few basic systems and recognize a common HVAC system when you see it.For the rest of this section, I'll describe a few HVAC systems that you may encounter on the jobsite. Understanding the basics of how the system works will help you to understand more later. The first thing that you need to understand with almost any HVAC system is the basics of air conditioning. The sketch below explains the air conditioning cycle.To understand the cooling cycle, follow the numbers below:The compressor takes the low pressure refrigerant and compresses it, increasing boththe temperature and the pressure. The actual temperature and pressure depend on the refrigerant being used.The condenser blows outside air over the refrigerant vapor, turning it into a liquid, typically about 25 F above the outside air temperature. Hence the hot air blowing out of the condenser.The expansion valve changes the refrigerant from a high pressure liquid to a low pressure liquid, dramatically lowering the temperature as well.The evaporator allows the warm room air to blow over the coils with cold refrigerant liquid, transferring heat to change the cold liquid to a warmer gas. Refrigerants are selected by their ability to absorb significant amounts of heat as they change state from a liquid to a gas.A good website for more detailed information on all aspects of HVAC work is theHVAC Prime Source.Now I'll lead you through a few basic HVAC systems, to help you name a few common systems.Heat Pumps:Like a refrigerator working in reverse, a heat pump extracts the heat from the air (or water) and uses it for heating. The cooling cycle is the normal vapor compression refrigerant process that's described above. The most common air to air heat pumps have the compressor and condenser in an outside unit. Then the refrigerant piping goes to an inside air handler unit which houses the expansion valve and the evaporator. These Split Systems normally have a 75' limit for the length of the refrigerant piping. During very cold weather, the heating side of the heat pump won't be able to pull enough heat from the outside air, so electric back-up resistive heaters are required. A separate system must be installed to bring outside air into the space. Heat pumps usually have one thermostat for the entire heat pump zone. System simplicity and low initial cost are the main benefit, while short life span (7 years is typical) and lack of control options are the principal drawbacks.Roof Top Units (Packaged Units):These complete heating and cooling units sit on the roof or outside on the ground and duct the conditioned air into the space. The heating side often uses gas furnaces, but other fuel options are available. The complete cooling cycle shown on the above sketch happens in the roof top unit. Since the units are outside, the mixing of outside air with the return air can be done easily. These packaged units produce a certain air temperature that goes into the duct distribution. Often the roof top unit produces cool air and certain zones may need that air warmed with electric duct heaters. System simplicity and low initial cost are the main benefit, while the main drawbacks are large vertical ducts running floor to floor and system control options.Water Source Heat Pumps:Also called a one pipe system, a single pipe carries water through the building which the individual water source heat pumps use for their heat source or heat sink. Typically the water in the loop pipe is about 80 F. This system requires a boiler to raise the loop water temperature and a cooling tower to lower the loop water temperature. Each zone, then, has a dedicated water source heat pump that is located inside the building. One of the benefits of this system is the ability to have a heat pump needing cooling and putting heat into the loop water while another heat pump calls for heating and takes heat out of the cooling loop. This system is extremely energy efficient during those times of the year. The main drawback is probably all the compressors located all through the interior, both for noise and maintenance.Chillers:The above systems are all considered Direct Expansion (DX) systems because the units provide for direct expansion of the refrigerant in the air cooling coils. Chillers, on the other hand, make cold water that gets distributed by pipes to air cooling coils. Chiller systems also require boilers to make hot water for the heating cycle. A two pipe system either cools or heats and a system changeover must occur to go from cooling to heating. In the cooling cycle, the one pipe supplies the cold water while the other pipe returns the warmed water (warmed by passing through the cooling coils with air blowing over the coils). A four pipe system doesn't need a system changeover, as each cooling coil unit has both a hot water supply and return and a cold water supply and return piped to it. The energy efficiency of these systems and the excellent control options are the biggest benefits, while initial cost and maintenance complexity are the drawbacks.Heaters:Hot air furnaces may burn gas, oil, coal, wood, etc. Radiant heaters, which produce infrared radiation which heats objects rather than the air adjacent to the heater, can be fueled by gas or electric. Electric resistance heaters are also common. Direct fired gas heaters, which use 100% fresh air and innovative fan distribution can also be an excellent heating solution for large spaces.Fans and Ventilation:The use of fans to ventilate a space for cooling and/or expulsion of indoor pollutants can be done in many ways. From a simple toilet exhaust fan to huge wall fans interconnected with wall louvers used for summer cooling, there are many ways to ventilate.",
  "How Does Air Distribution Work?": "Since most of the HVAC systems installed in commercial buildings use air distribution, take some time to understand how air flows from diffusers. The training modules produced by Price do an excellent job of teaching the concepts in a few minutes. Review thespace air diffusionvideo to learn more.",
  "What Should I Know about Rough Sizing Systems?": "Have you ever talked to the Project Owner as he contemplates adding a few rooms to the project? That type of discussion happens occasionally on the construction site, as Owner's seem to always be considering options and changes during construction. If an owner discusses adding 1000 sf of office, it's handy to know that about 3 tons of air conditioning will be needed. As I've mentioned before, that general knowledge of building provides a sense of competence that can carry you far.So how do you have a sense of rough sizing HVAC systems? Consider the type of projects you build and consult the table below for the area factor. The above example used a 1000 sf office space, which has about 350 sf per ton of air conditioning. So 1000 sf/350 sf/ton = about 3 ton.Building TypeSF/tonOffice areas or retail350Conference rooms100 to 200Dedicated computer rooms50 to 100Classrooms250Industrial300Arenas150 to 200Residential600 to 700Therefore, if you're building a school, just remember that every 1,000 sf will need about 4 tons of air conditioning. Of course, you need to remember that this rough sizing varies by the amount of insulation, the amount and orientation of glazing, the amount of exterior wall and the climate.If you want to further rough size air duct systems, you may want to purchase aDuctulator, a hand held rotating calculator that aids in understanding air duct sizes, air velocities and air flows. These additional rules of thumb will help you use it:Normal comfort air conditioning uses about 400 cfm per ton.Precision air conditioning (for dedicated computer rooms) uses about 500 cfm per ton.Dehumidification uses about 200 cfm per ton.Air flow at diffusers should be 600 to 700 feet per minute to be fairly quiet.Air flow in main ducts should be 1,000 to 1,200 feet per minute to be fairly quiet.Air flow for kitchen exhaust hoods will be in the 2,500 feet per minute range.",
  "What Should I Know about ": "While we construct the buildings, other people will live and work and play in them for many years afterward. Learn to contemplate how the building will work for those future occupants. With the understanding of a few basic concepts, you can have a sense of how the building will use energy in the future.The average amount spent on energy use for office buildings seems to be about $1.80/sf per year. So a 10,000 sf office building will pay about $18,000 per year for electric, gas and oil. Lighting tends to be the largest part of that cost for most commercial buildings. The new energy conservation codes require less than 1 watt/sf of lighting energy usage, but many existing buildings use 2 to 3 watts/sf for lighting. An example below illustrates:Theenergy use of commercial buildingsis shown in this US Department of Energy report. Thelighting use of commercial buildingsis shown in this US DOE report. Finally, thecosts per sf spent on energyare shown in this US DOE report.",

  "How Do Sprinkler Heads Work?": "Did you ever notice that a common gag for TV sitcoms is to have the automatic fire protection sprinklers go off? It's always the same, some smoke happens and all these sprinkler heads soak the hapless suckers standing there. Since almost none of us ever experience a sprinkler head discharge, the TV show experience seems true to many people.\u00a0 Please understand that it's completely false.Smoke sets off smoke alarms, not sprinkler heads. Only heat makes sprinkler heads flow water. A typical sprinkler head has a thermal fuse of 174\ufffdF that must melt to release water flow. The head next to it won't go off unless it too melts. So intense heat sets off sprinkler heads, and only the actual heads that experience the intense heat.Sprinkler heads have either a glass bulb heat sensitive mechanism or a metal fusible link. With this type of activation, only the sprinkler heads directly above the fire tend to flow water. Therefore, the maximum amount of water douses the hottest fire location.Different temperature sprinkler heads are used for various situations. The table below shows common options.Color of liquid inside bulbTemp in\ufffdFTemp in\ufffdCOrange13557Red15568Yellow17479Green20093Blue286141Mauve360182Black440227You can find much more information on sprinkler heads atTyco Fire and Building Productsor atReliable Sprinkler.",
  "What Should I Know About Sprinkler Systems?": "A wet sprinkler system has a series of water distribution pipes and sprinkler heads throughout every space in a facility. The sprinkler heads are typically located between 10' and 15' on center in both directions. The pipes are full of water, so if heat from a fire raises the temperature, the fusible link or glass bulb will break and allow water to flow onto the fire. The amount of water may be in the 15 to 40 gallons per minute range, which is much less than a fire hose that may flow 250 to 1000 gallons per minute. In theory, the sprinkler system will control the fire with much less water damage to the facility.Generally systems have control valves for maintenance and repairs that must be monitored with anti-tamper switches. Flow controls also are typically monitored so any flow in the system, especially during non-occupied times, gets reported quickly. If you want a much more detailed explanation of sprinkler systems, go to the Stanford UniversityIntro to Automatic Fire Protection Systems.While sprinklers aren't required in all buildings, the current US building codes (IBC and UBC) provide many design advantages for buildings that include sprinklers. Egress requirements, building construction type, fire separation requirements and many more design items have relaxed requirements in sprinklered buildings. Hence many Design Professionals specify sprinklers and consider it an overall cost savings.Where water may freeze in the pipes, a dry sprinkler system can be used. An air compressor must provide air at a pressure higher than the water pressure in the sprinkler system so the dry system remains full of compressed air. When a sprinkler head activates, the air rushes out and the water soon (less than one minute) follows. Dry systems have several complications not found with wet systems, so only get used where pipe freezing is a concern.Deluge systems don't use sprinkler heads to control the water flow. The piping is open at the point of water discharge and the water flow is controlled by a valve connected to the fire alarm system. A deluge system will have water flowing from all discharge points simultaneously, as soon as the fire alarm calls for flow. Only in special occupancies in which rapid fire spread is a major concern do deluge systems get installed.Pre-action sprinkler systems provide another layer of safety from accidental sprinkler discharge. You can imagine a museum or a library could sustain tremendous losses from water damage, so they want to assure that sprinkler heads don't discharge by mistake. Though system types vary, generally an action (the flowing of water at a head location) must be proceeded by a pre-action (a smoke or heat alarm confirming that a fire is likely in progress). So a Pre-Action sprinkler system has a double check prior to water flowing.",
  "What Piping Configurations are Common?": "The sketch below shows various common piping configurations.The other component of the sprinkler piping is the control valving. While requirements vary based on local rules, the following US Department of Defense sketch shows a typical layout.",
  "What are the Basics of Sprinkler System Design?": "It's a good idea to understand sprinkler system design (the basics aren't too complicated). The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) sets the design standards in the publication NFPA-13. The following few steps show the process.Determine the level of fire hazard for the building.Light Hazard (offices, churches, hospitals, nursing homes, gyms, schools, theaters, residential, etc.)Ordinary Hazard Group 1 (bakeries, dairy plants, electronic plants, glass manufacturing, parking garages, etc.)Ordinary Hazard Group 2 (chemical plants, mercantile, paper mills, repair garages, woodworking shops, etc.)Extra Hazard Group 1 (aircraft hangars, plywood manufacturing, printing, textile plants, etc.)Extra Hazard Group 2 (asphalt saturating, flammable liquid spraying, manufactured home plants, plastics processing, etc.)Find the Design Area and DensityDesign Area = the worst case area in a building where a fire could burnDesign Density = the gallons per minute of water per square foot that should flow onto the Design AreaSprinkler Head locations and piping designAn example always helps. An office building has a light hazard classification, the Design Area is the most remote 1,500 sf and the Design Density is 0.1 gallons per minute/sf. Therefore this system requires 1,500 sf x 0.1 gpm/sf  = 150 gallons per minute to be discharged over that most remote 1,500 sf area. If we look instead to a manufacturing facility, the Design Density changes to 0.2 gpm/sf. Therefore, we'd need 300 gpm to be spray over the most remote 1,500 sf area.The table below from the US Department of Defense provides some of the design basics. To really understand the design work, you need a copy of NFPA-13, but this table shows the basic concept.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Sprinkler \rBasics:": "Sprinkler heads act independently, only discharging water when the temperature at that head exceeds the allowable range.A sprinkler head flows about 40 gpm, while a fire hose flows in excess of 250 gpm.Pre-Action sprinkler systems provide a double check prior to water flowing.",

  "How Can I Understand the Basics of Electricity?": "Imagine yourself standing with a garden hose, ready to soak some unsuspecting passerby. The hose has water pressure and the water will flow through the hose onto the passerby when you open the nozzle. Prior to spraying, though, you stop and think about the similarities between water flow in a hose and electrical current flow in a wire.You know that a pump, operating somewhere, creates the water pressure in the hose, which is measured in pounds per square inch (psi). That water pressure places the water in a \"Ready to Flow\" state. Similarly, an electric generator creates an electromotive force (EMF), which is measured in volts. The electricity in the wire is in a \"Ready to Flow\" state and has a certain voltage or EMF.Now if you open the nozzle of that water hose, the unsuspecting passerby will get drenched with a flow of water. That water flow gets described in gallons per minute (gpm). The electrical rate of flow is defined as Current (I) and gets measured in Amps. In order for a motor to turn or a light bulb illuminate, current must flow.The third parallel between a water hose and an electrical wire concerns resistance. If you have several hundred feet of hose coiled at your feet that the water must pass through, not much water will emerge from the hose to spray that unsuspecting passerby. The head loss in the hose due to friction will greatly reduce the water flow and the water pressure. Similarly, resistance in an electrical circuit, either from a long wire not properly sized or an electrical device can reduce both EMF and current flow.To recap, remember that the EMF (electromotive force measured in volts) is like the water pressure (psi), while the current flow (amps) is like the water flow (gpm).",
  "What Are the Basic Electrical Formulas?": "To understand electricity, the basic formulas shown below are essential.If you'd rather look at some electric formulas developed from the US military. Here's another set:",
  "What Is the Difference between DC and AC?": "DC stands for Direct Current. A circuit powered by a battery is a DC circuit. Most electronic devices run on DC. Continuing with the analogy of water in a hose, a DC circuit has all the water flow in one direction. The reason why all electrical power isn't DC, though, is because it can't be easily transmitted long distances or changed into other voltages.\u00a0So the early days of electrical power used DC, but required large diameter wiring (expensive) and local power generators (impractical).Therefore, a more efficient type of electrical power developed...Alternating Current. When thinking about AC, the analogy of the water hose no longer works well. In AC, the current flow reverses direction in a circuit, flowing first in one direction, then in the other. This reversal of flow takes place 60 times in one second for typical electrical AC power in America. Thus the AC power is called 60 cycle (or 60 Hertz). The normal AC power in much of the rest of the world is 50 cycle. The number of cycles is chosen as a mostly arbitrary standard. The map shown in this Wikipedia linkhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequencyillustrates the standard voltages and frequencies most countries in the world chose.As an aside, lights and motors tend to be designed to work at either 50 cycles or 60 cycles. The wrong frequency in lights causes a flicker and in motors more serious problems can occur. Understand that electrical appliances typically are designed for 60 cycle or 50 cycle power and will have problems with efficiency, or even safety, if the correct frequency isn't used.AC power became the standard throughout the world, mostly because transformers allow AC power to change voltages. So Utility Companies can produce electricity and send it over high voltage lines (say 11,000 volts), then simply transform the power to 120 volts for normal use. This ability to send high voltage power over transmission lines allows more power to be sent over smaller diameter cable, and with less transmission loss, than DC power would allow.",
  "How Is Single Phase AC Different from Three Phase AC?": "To begin with the simple, practical information, single phase AC power requires 3 wires: a hot, a neutral and a ground. Three phase requires 5 wires: 3 hots, a neutral and a ground. In three phase, each of the hot wires can complete a circuit with the neutral. Three phase power can carry more electrical capacity than single phase. Starting a 10 hp motor (starting a motor can require 6 times more power than running a motor) may cause a single phase line to blink or have a low voltage. A three phase line could allow that 10 hp motor to start without problem. Generally, three phase motors are more compact and efficient than similarly sized single phased motors, so the use of three phase motors is widespread. Large motors get used in so many applications: elevators, fans, blowers, compressors, pumps, conveyor drives, etc., so many projects require three phase electrical power.To understand three phase power, think about the 60 cycles of alternating current electricity, discussed above. Each 1/60th of a second has a directional shift in the current. The current flows in one direction, then back in the other direction. The 3 Phase Electrical Wave figure below illustrates the black line (phase #1) flowing in one direction at 0, then flowing in the other direction at 180 and finally flowing back in the original direction at 360. The red line (phase #2) and the blue line (phase #3) start off the directional shifts at different times. This phase separation must be considered to get the correct phase rotation when wiring induction motors. In other words, one hook-up makes the motor run forward, the other hook-up makes it run backwards.So the three phase electrical system has 3 conductors carrying voltage waveforms (shown above) that are offset in time by 120 degrees or 1/3 of a cycle.When designing three phase electrical systems, one strives to balance the load between phases. In a 5 wire, 120/208 volt system, two of the hots create a 208 volt circuit while a hot and a neutral create a 120 volt circuit. One tries to balance the load (current), voltage and impedance on each of the phases. Of course a perfect balancing never happens. But too much of an imbalance causes higher operating temperature, shorter motor life and less efficiency.",
  "What Is the Difference between KW and KVA?": "Electrical utility companies provide volt-amperes to customers, but bill them for watts. Understanding this concept will help you better understand many of the decisions made by project owners and electrical engineers. Since the Power Law shown above lists Watts = Volts x Amps, you may think that the number of volt-amperes should be the same as the number of watts. After all, that's what the Power Law equation states. And it's true when the load is resistive, say an electrical heating element that uses all the power that is delivered to it by changing the electrical energy into heat energy. A motor or a fluorescent light, on the other hand, are reactive loads in that part of the electrical power that goes to them gets absorbed, then returned to the circuit without being used. The reactive portion of the load dissipates no power.Let's look at it a different way. When trying to understand generators that are specified for a project, you will often see them listed with KVA numbers. So what does that mean?If you know that you will have 100 amps of load at 208 volts, you'd need an transformer with at least 20.8 KVA. If you installed that transformer and measured the volts you'd see 208 volts and an amp meter would show 100 amps. But since part of that current goes back into the circuit without being used, the real power (or the KiloWatts) would be less than 20.8 KW. The figure below illustrates:So with our generator example above, if the power factor is 0.8, then the real power used will be 20.8 KVA x 0.8 power factor or 16.6 KW.Since we're discussing generators, it's good to know that the industry standard power factor assumed for rating generators is 0.8. But the reality of what the generator will actually drive under load depends on the actual power factor. To continue with the above example, if you use a 16.6 KW generator but lots of small induction motors are being powered and the true power factor is 0.6, then the apparent power required will be 16.6 KW / 0.6 = 27.7 KVA. The right conclusion to draw, though, is to discuss and purchase generators using the KVA requirements, not the KW.",
  "What Is the Power Factor?": "The illustration above shows that the power factor is a number between 0 and 1.0 that is a ratio between the true power (KW) and the apparent power (KVA). Some typical power factors are shown below:Various types of loadsPower factorElectric resistive heating1.0Incandescent lighting1.0Incandescent lighting with a step down transformer0.95 to 0.98Fluorescent lighting0.5 to 0.95Single phase induction motor up to 1 HP0.55 to 0.75Single phase induction motor 1 HP to 10 HP0.75 to 0.85Three phase induction motor 1 HP to 10 HP0.75 to 0.91Electric welding transformers0.50 to 0.70Synchronous motors0.80 to 1.0As you can see, power factors can vary widely depending on the loads. So why does that matter? Power companies don't like supplying the apparent power requirements but only getting paid for the true power that's used. So an industrial plant with a low power factor has to have lots more energy supplied to it than it pays for, creating an inefficiency for the power companies. As you can imagine, power companies tend to prize efficiency, so they typically bill that industrial client with the low power factor a penalty to encourage them to improve. Under-loadedinduction motorsoften lower a power factor, so an industrial plant may replace those motors with smaller capacity motors or going withsynchronous motors.",
  "What Should I Know about Generators?": "I know one thing I wish I'd known about diesel generators is that they need their oil level checked daily if they are running 24/7. I had rented a 25 KVA diesel generator for a factory we were building in the middle of nowhere. That old generator just ran and ran...till it didn't. When the service guys came out and asked me when I'd last checked the oil, I gave them that dumb blank stare. Then I responded with the pitiful, \"But you never told me I needed to check the oil.\" Paying to help repair the engine on the generator helped me remember the lesson.If you need to provide temporary electric on a jobsite, diesel, gasoline or propane generators often solve the problem. Trying to determine the size generator you need can also be a challenge. The following Honda websitehttp://www.hondapowerequipment.com/genwat.aspshows the power requirements for lots of devices. The big difference in current draw for motors starting vs just running should be noted. I was also surprised how much energy computers use.A site to compare pricing and features for industrial generatorshttp://www.gopower.com/shows the options available. The first decision concerns the fuel used to power the generator; the normal options are diesel, natural gas or propane. Deciding which items will be powered in a power outage determines the size of the generator, typically in KVA. The location of the proposed generator leads to the type of housing required.As an interesting aside, I came across instructions to build theworld's simplest generator. You may want to kill some time playing around with this or help a kid with a science project or some such thing. This simple device clearly shows the definition of an electric generator as a device that changes mechanical energy into electrical energy. On the other hand, a motor changes electrical energy into mechanical energy.Volume IVof the US DOE Handbook of Electrical Science illustrates components of a generator in the figure below.",
  "What Should I Know about Transformers?": "A transformer transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another by magnetic coupling. In other words, the number of coils on the primary side of a transformer create a magnetic field when a current passes through it. Therefore, the secondary side of the circuit, with a different number of coil windings, will have a different voltage. The modern use of electricity requires that very high voltage, low current flows travel the long distances between the electrical generation source and the point of use. In almost any modern use of electricity, several voltage increases and decreases will occur. Since transformers are extremely efficient, there are few losses between their input power and output power.The sketch below illustrates a simple transformer fromVolume IVof the US DOE Handbook of Electrical Science.",
  "What Should I Know about Metering, Switchgear and Panels?": "The electrical power portion of most buildings will include metering, switchgear and distribution panels. A Construction Supervisor should have a basic understanding of what these elements do. The metering allows the power company to keep track of how much electricity gets used. The largest amount of electricity used at one time (the Demand) and the power factor also are important on buildings that have more inductive loads like motors.Then a main breaker will be required in the switchgear, allowing the entire electrical system to be turned off. From this main breaker, the current flows through circuit breaker panels and sub-panels. Typically a one line diagram shows the general concept of the electrical power system and includes metering, switchgear and panels.",
  "What Do Fuses or Circuit Breakers Do?": "A fuse or circuit breaker protects the wiring in an electrical circuit from allowing too much current to flow. A short circuit, for example, could be caused by two wires mistakenly crossed (a nail driven through the wall and touching two wires) that could cause a huge current flow and start a fire. Without fuses and circuit breakers, electrical circuits would simply catch on fire too many times for electricity to be considered a safe and practical energy to use. Since equipment will fail and wiring problems will happen, fuses or circuit breakers need to be included in circuits for safety.Fuses work on the simple concept that when current flows through wire it generates heat, the more current flow, the more heat. The thin wire in a fuse will only allow a certain amount of current to run through it until it heats and disintegrates. The thin wire in the fuse is now gone and no current can flow the circuit. When current was flowing through the fuse and the rest of the circuit, it was a closed circuit, but when the fuse blows, it becomes an open circuit. No current flows in an open circuit. So fuses work well, but they only work one time. After the wire in a fuse burns out, that fuse must be removed and thrown away and a new fuse must be installed.The circuit breaker accomplishes the same function as a fuse, but uses a simple switch to detect over-current situations. Therefore the circuit breaker can trip and be reset many times. Follow the link for a slightly more detailed explanation abouthow circuit breakers work.",
  "What Are the Fundamentals of Electronics?": "How the heck should I know? I plan and build buildings for a living. I did find some interesting US Navy training courses that provide a tremendous amount of useful information.

  "How Does Analog Differ from Digital?": "To understand analog signals, think about a microphone. The sound pressure from your voice causes an element in the microphone to vibrate. Over time that element moves with a different frequency (cycles per second) and amplitude (distance it moves or wavelength). So an analog signal is a time continuous signal that has wavelength and frequency. The stylus on a record player picks up the variations in the groove that are analogous to the actual sounds. That's where the term \"Analog\" comes from. The human hear also works in an analog manner, determining the in real time the vibrations that carry frequency and wavelength of the sound.Digital signals, on the other hand, are just a series of 0s and 1s. The pattern of these 0s and 1s (called a binary system) convert an analog signal (which is the physical properties of the sounds) into bits of information that can be stored, transmitted and converted back into an analog signal. The accuracy of the conversion (the quality of the sound) depends on the sampling rate (how often the sound gets converted) and the sampling depth (how much information is included in each conversion). Think of a low quality photo from a cheap cell phone camera, the sampling rate and depth is low, so the quality of the photo is poor. Conversely, a 5 Megapixel digital camera provides an extremely clear photo.Another key difference between digital signals and analog signals is that digital signals don't operate in real time like an analog signal. Your ear hears that sound pressure and converts it to an analog signal in real time, as the sound happens. Digital sound gets stored in bits of information and needs to be converted back to analog real time (whether in an image or a sound) to make sense to our analog selves.A standard clock illustrates the principle in another way. As the second hand sweeps the dial and the minute and hour hands slowly move, the clocks acts as an analog device. It works continuously through time. So you can look at an analog clock and know the time is 1 minute and 37 seconds after 2:00.A digital clock typically will show only the hours and the minutes, changing from one minute to the next. So does that make the digital clock less able to give accurate time than an analog clock? Not necessarily. Think sampling rate and sampling depth. The digital clock could be programmed to show time to the thousandth or millionth of a second. The point to remember is that neither analog nor digital signals are inherently better, just different.The following rates for transmitting data are helpful:Copper phone line and dial up modem30 kilobits per secondDSO64 kilobits per secondISDN144 kilobits per secondDSL1.5 megabits per secondT1 line (= 24 DSO lines)1.5 megabits per secondFiber cable, commercial applications2 to 5 megabits per secondFiber cable, top end applicationsup to 30 megabits per secondT3 line (= 28 T1 lines)43 megabits per second",
  "How Do Fiber Optics work?": "With the understanding of digital signals from the section above, fiber optics become fairly easy to visualize. Think about a very long flexible piece of 2\" flexible pipe, say a mile long. Imagine the inside of this pipe was completely mirrored, reflecting any light that hits the pipe wall. If you stand at one end of this pipe and shine a flashlight into the pipe, you could turn your light on and off and give Morse code signals. Your buddy at the other end of the pipe could easily see and understand the light signals coming through the pipe. That's how fiber optic cable works.A piece of fiber optic cable is made of incredibly pure glass, so light can be transmitted miles without degradation. The thickness of the fiber optic strand is similar to a human hair. The fiber optic glass strand gets coated plastic, which allows all the light that goes in the one end to come out the other end.So fiber optics become a great way to send digital signals. The on-off nature of digital information allows the signal to be sent at the speed of light. The light laser can turn on and off several billion times per second (try that with your flashlight!) and use light colors as well to transmit billions of bits per second through an individual fiber optic strand. At the other end of the strand, the light signal gets converted back to a digital electric signal and finally back to an analog signal.A fiber optic line currently can carry a signal about 60 miles before it needs to be read and re-transmitted at full strength to the next transmission station.",
  "Tricks of the Trade & Rules of Thumb for Electrical \rBasics:": "The EMF (electromotive force measured in volts) is like the water pressure (psi), while the current flow (amps) is like the water flow (gpm).The power law states that Watts = Amps x Volts, but always consider the power factor.The power factor is the real power (in kilowatts) divided by the apparent power (in kilovolts x amps) and is always between 0 and 1.Analog signals are continuous in time and have frequency and wavelength, digital signals are bits that get stored.Understand fiber optics by thinking about a long flexible pipe with a flashlight shining into one end giving Morse code."
